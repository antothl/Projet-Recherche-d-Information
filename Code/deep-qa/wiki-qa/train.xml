How	will	I	feel	after	my	Rhizotomy	surgery?

This	article	deals	with	Selective	Dorsal	Rhizotomy	(SDR)	rather	than	the	rhizotomy	procedures	for	pain	relief	;	for	those	procedures,	which	have	begun	to	take	the	name	"rhizotomy"	in	certain	instances,	see	facet	rhizotomy	and	similar.
</negative>
<negative>
A	rhizotomy	(	)	is	a	term	chiefly	referring	to	a	neurosurgical	procedure	that	selectively	destroys	problematic	nerve	roots	in	the	spinal	cord	,	most	often	to	relieve	the	symptoms	of	neuromuscular	conditions	such	as	spastic	diplegia	and	other	forms	of	spastic	cerebral	palsy	.
</negative>
<negative>
The	selective	dorsal	rhizotomy	(SDR)	for	spastic	cerebral	palsy	has	been	the	main	use	of	rhizotomy	for	neurosurgeons	specialising	in	spastic	CP	since	the	1980s;	in	this	surgery,	the	spasticity-causing	nerves	are	isolated	and	then	targeted	and	destroyed.
</negative>
<negative>
The	sensory	nerve	roots,	where	spasticity	is	located,	are	first	separated	from	the	motor	ones,	and	the	nerve	fibres	to	be	cut	are	then	identified	via	electromyographic	stimulation.
</negative>
<negative>
The	ones	producing	spasticity	are	then	selectively	lesioned	with	tiny	electrical	pulses.
</negative>
<negative>
In	spasticity,	rhizotomy	precisely	targets	and	destroys	the	damaged	nerves	that	don’t	receive	gamma	amino	butyric	acid	,	which	is	the	core	problem	for	people	with	spastic	cerebral	palsy	.
</negative>
<negative>
These	over-firing,	non-GABA-absorbing	nerves	generate	unusual	electrical	activity	during	the	EMG	testing	phase	in	SDR	and	are	thus	considered	to	be	the	source	of	the	patient's	hypertonia	;	they	are	eliminated	with	the	electrical	pulses	once	identified,	while	the	remaining	nerves	and	nerve	routes	carrying	the	correct	messages	remain	fully	intact	and	untouched.
</negative>
<negative>
This	means	that	the	spasticity	is	permanently	dissolved,	and	that	this	is	done	without	affecting	nervous	system	sensitivity	or	function	in	other	areas,	because	the	only	nerves	destroyed	are	the	over-firing	ones	responsible	for	the	muscle	tightness.

The	terms	rhizotomy	and	neurotomy	are	also	increasingly	becoming	interchangeable	in	the	treatment	of	chronic	back	pain	from	degenerative	disc	disease	.

This	is	a	procedure	called	a	facet	rhizotomy	and	is	not	a	surgical	procedure	but	is	instead	done	on	an	outpatient	basis	using	a	simple	probe	to	apply	radiofrequency	waves	to	the	impinged	pain-causing	nerve	root	lying	between	the	facet	joint	and	the	vertebral	body.
</negative>
<negative>
Such	radio	frequency	nerve	lesioning	results	in	five	to	eight	or	more	months	of	pain	relief	before	the	nerve	regenerates	and	another	round	of	the	procedure	needs	to	be	performed.
</negative>
<negative>
A	facet	rhizotomy	is	just	one	of	many	different	forms	of	radiofrequency	ablation	,	and	its	use	of	the	"rhizotomy"	name	should	not	be	confused	with	the	SDR	procedure.

Dred	Scott	v.	Sandford,	,	also	known	as	the	Dred	Scott	Decision,	was	a	landmark	decision	by	the	U.S.	Supreme	Court	.
</negative>
<negative>
It	made	two	main	rulings.
</negative>
<negative>
The	first	ruling	was	that	African-Americans	were	not	citizens,	and	therefore	had	no	standing	to	sue	in	federal	court.
</negative>
<negative>
The	second	ruling	was	that	the	federal	government	had	no	power	to	regulate	slavery	in	any	territory	acquired	subsequent	to	the	creation	of	the	United	States.
</negative>
<negative>
Given	the	first	ruling,	most	scholars	and	many	contemporary	political	figures	(including	the	leadership	of	the	then-new	Republican	Party)	considered	that	the	second	ruling	was	not	binding	precedent,	but	mere	dictum	.
</negative>
<negative>
The	rationale	of	the	Supreme	Court	regarding	the	jurisdictional	ruling	implied	that	people	of	African	descent	(both	slave	and	free)	were	not	protected	by	the	Constitution	and	were	not	U.S.	citizens	.
</negative>
<negative>
Since	passage	of	the	14th	Amendment	to	the	U.S.	Constitution	,	both	rulings	are	superseded	and	no	longer	valid	precedent.
</negative>
<negative>
Nonetheless,	the	case	retains	historical	significance	as	it	is	widely	regarded	as	the	worst	decision	ever	made	by	the	Supreme	Court.
</negative>
<negative>
The	opinion	of	the	court,	written	by	Chief	Justice	Roger	B.	Taney	,	stirred	debate.

<negative>
For	the	first	time	since	Marbury	v.	Madison	,	the	Court	held	an	Act	of	Congress	to	be	unconstitutional.
</negative>
<negative>
Dred	Scott	,	an	African-American	slave,	had	asked	a	United	States	Circuit	Court	to	award	him	his	freedom	because	he	and	his	master	had	resided	in	a	state	(	Illinois	)	and	a	territory	(	Wisconsin	Territory	)	where	slavery	had	been	banned.
</negative>
<negative>
Chief	Justice	Roger	Taney	,	writing	for	the	court,	held	that	Scott,	as	a	person	of	African	ancestry,	was	not	a	citizen	of	the	United	States	and	therefore	had	no	right	to	sue	in	federal	court.
</negative>
<negative>
This	holding	was	contrary	to	the	practice	of	numerous	states	at	the	time,	particularly	Free	states	,	where	free	blacks	did	in	fact	enjoy	the	rights	of	citizens,	such	as	the	right	to	vote	and	hold	public	office.
</negative>
<negative>
In	what	is	sometimes	considered	mere	obiter	dictum	,	the	Court	went	on	to	hold	that	Congress	had	no	authority	to	prohibit	slavery	in	federal	territories	because	slaves	are	personal	property	and	the	Fifth	Amendment	to	the	Constitution	protects	property	owners	against	deprivation	of	their	property	without	due	process	of	law	.
</negative>

In	reaching	this	decision,	Taney	had	hoped	to	settle	the	growing	controversy	surrounding	slavery	in	the	United	States,	but	it	had	the	opposite	effect.

<negative>
The	decision	was	fiercely	debated	across	the	country,	as	perhaps	best	exemplified	by	the	Lincoln–Douglas	debates	of	1858.
</negative>
<negative>
Abraham	Lincoln	,	the	second-ever	Republican	nominee	for	President,	was	able	to	win	the	presidential	election	in	1860	;	the	stopping	of	the	further	expansion	of	slavery	was	a	key	Republican	party	plank.
</negative>
<negative>
The	decision	played	an	important	role	in	the	timing	of	state	secession	and	the	Civil	War,	although	it	is	extreme	to	say	the	decision	"caused"	the	war.

<negative>
The	decision	is	acknowledged	for	the	influential	role	it	played	in	altering	the	national	political	landscape:	it	is	credited	with	launching	Abraham	Lincoln’s	national	political	career	and	ultimately	allowing	for	his	election.
</negative>
<negative>
Although	the	Supreme	Court	has	never	explicitly	overruled	the	Dred	Scott	case,	the	Court	stated	in	the	Slaughter-House	Cases	that	at	least	one	part	of	it	had	already	been	overruled	by	the	Fourteenth	Amendment	in	1868,	which	begins	by	stating,	"All	persons	born	or	naturalized	in	the	United	States,	and	subject	to	the	jurisdiction	thereof,	are	citizens	of	the	United	States	and	of	the	State	wherein	they	reside."

<negative>
It	declares	that	persons	may	be	citizens	of	the	United	States	without	regard	to	their	citizenship	of	a	particular	State,	and	it	overturns	the	Dred	Scott	decision	by	making	all	persons	born	within	the	United	States	and	subject	to	its	jurisdiction	citizens	of	the	United	States.

What	does	the	term	"mens	rea"	mean

In	criminal	law	,	it	is	viewed	as	one	of	the	necessary	elements	of	some	crimes	.
</negative>
<negative>
The	standard	common	law	test	of	criminal	liability	is	usually	expressed	in	the	Latin	phrase,	actus	non	facit	reum	nisi	mens	sit	rea,	which	means	"the	act	is	not	culpable	unless	the	mind	is	guilty".
</negative>
<negative>
Thus,	in	jurisdictions	with	due	process	,	there	must	be	an	actus	reus	,	or	"guilty	act,"	accompanied	by	some	level	of	mens	rea	to	constitute	the	crime	with	which	the	defendant	is	charged	(see	the	technical	requirement	of	concurrence	).

What	implication(s)	does	the	law	of	conservation	of	matter	have	for	humans?
</question>
<negative>
Antoine	Lavoisier	's	discovery	of	the	Law	of	Conservation	of	Mass	led	to	many	new	findings	in	the	19th	century.
</negative>
<negative>
Joseph	Proust	's	law	of	definite	proportions	and	John	Dalton	's	atomic	theory	branched	from	the	discoveries	of	Antoine	Lavoisier.
</negative>
<negative>
Lavoisier's	quantitative	experiments	revealed	that	combustion	involved	oxygen	rather	than	what	was	previously	thought	to	be	phlogiston	.
</negative>
<negative>
The	law	of	conservation	of	mass,	or	principle	of	mass	conservation,	states	that	for	any	system	closed	to	all	transfers	of	matter	and	energy	(both	of	which	have	mass),	the	mass	of	the	system	must	remain	constant	over	time,	as	system	mass	cannot	change	quantity	if	it	is	not	added	or	removed.
</negative>
<negative>
Hence,	the	quantity	of	mass	is	"conserved"	over	time.
</negative>
<negative>
The	law	implies	that	mass	can	neither	be	created	nor	destroyed,	although	it	may	be	rearranged	in	space,	or	the	entities	associated	with	it	may	be	changed	in	form,	as	for	example	when	light	or	physical	work	is	transformed	into	particles	that	contribute	the	same	mass	to	the	system	as	the	light	or	work	had	contributed.
</negative>
<negative>
The	law	implies	(requires)	that	during	any	chemical	reaction	,	nuclear	reaction	,	or	radioactive	decay	in	an	isolated	system,	the	mass	of	the	reactants	or	starting	material	must	equal	the	mass	of	the	products.
</negative>
<negative>
The	concept	of	mass	conservation	is	widely	used	in	many	fields	such	as	chemistry	,	mechanics	,	and	fluid	dynamics	.
</negative>
<negative>
Historically,	mass	conservation	was	discovered	in	chemical	reactions	by	Antoine	Lavoisier	in	the	late	18th	century,	and	was	of	crucial	importance	in	the	progress	from	alchemy	to	the	modern	natural	science	of	chemistry	.
</negative>
<negative>
The	closely	related	concept	of	matter	conservation	was	found	to	hold	good	in	chemistry	to	such	high	approximation	that	it	failed	only	for	the	high	energies	treated	by	the	later	refinements	of	relativity	theory,	but	otherwise	remains	useful	and	sufficiently	accurate	for	most	chemical	calculations,	even	in	modern	practice.
</negative>
<negative>
In	special	relativity	,	needed	for	accuracy	when	large	energy	transfers	between	systems	is	involved,	the	difference	between	thermodynamically	closed	and	isolated	systems	becomes	important,	since	conservation	of	mass	is	strictly	and	perfectly	upheld	only	for	so-called	isolated	systems	,	i.e.	those	completely	isolated	from	all	exchanges	with	the	environment.
</negative>
<negative>
In	this	circumstance,	the	mass-energy	equivalence	theorem	states	that	mass	conservation	is	equivalent	to	total	energy	conservation,	which	is	the	first	law	of	thermodynamics	.
</negative>
<negative>
By	contrast,	for	a	thermodynamically	closed	system	(i.e.,	one	which	is	closed	to	exchanges	of	matter,	but	open	to	exchanges	of	non-material	energy,	such	as	heat	and	work,	with	the	surroundings)	mass	is	(usually)	only	approximately	conserved.
</negative>
<negative>
The	input	or	output	of	non-material	energy	must	change	the	mass	of	the	system	in	relativity	theory,	although	the	change	is	usually	small,	since	relatively	large	amounts	of	such	energy	(by	comparison	with	ordinary	experience)	carry	only	a	small	amount	of	mass	(again	by	ordinary	standards	of	measurement).
</negative>
<negative>
In	special	relativity,	mass	is	not	converted	to	energy,	since	energy	in	all	of	its	forms	always	retains	its	equivalent	amount	of	mass	throughout	any	transformation	or	translocation	into,	or	out	of,	a	system.
</negative>
<negative>
However,	certain	types	of	matter	(a	different	concept)	may	be	converted	to	energy,	so	long	as	the	mass	of	the	system	is	unchanged	in	the	process.
</negative>
<negative>
However,	if	such	energy	is	removed	from	systems,	they	must	lose	the	mass	that	is	associated	with	it.
</negative>
<negative>
In	general	relativity	,	mass	(and	energy)	conservation	in	expanding	volumes	of	space	is	a	complex	concept,	subject	to	different	definitions,	and	neither	mass	nor	energy	is	as	strictly	and	simply	conserved	as	is	the	case	in	special	relativity	and	in	Minkowski	space	.

In	a	VUL,	the	cash	value	can	be	invested	in	a	wide	variety	of	separate	accounts	,	similar	to	mutual	funds	,	and	the	choice	of	which	of	the	available	separate	accounts	to	use	is	entirely	up	to	the	contract	owner.
</negative>
<negative>
The	'variable'	component	in	the	name	refers	to	this	ability	to	invest	in	separate	accounts	whose	values	vary—they	vary	because	they	are	invested	in	stock	and/or	bond	markets.

The	premiums	can	vary	from	nothing	in	a	given	month	up	to	maximums	defined	by	the	Internal	Revenue	Code	for	life	insurance.
</negative>
<negative>
This	flexibility	is	in	contrast	to	whole	life	insurance	that	has	fixed	premium	payments	that	typically	cannot	be	missed	without	lapsing	the	policy	(although	one	may	exercise	an	Automatic	Premium	Loan	feature,	or	surrender	dividends	to	pay	a	Whole	Life	premium).

<negative>
Variable	universal	life	is	a	type	of	permanent	life	insurance	,	because	the	death	benefit	will	be	paid	if	the	insured	dies	any	time	as	long	as	there	is	sufficient	cash	value	to	pay	the	costs	of	insurance	in	the	policy.

With	most	if	not	all	VULs,	unlike	whole	life,	there	is	no	endowment	age	(the	age	at	which	the	cash	value	equals	the	death	benefit	amount,	which	for	whole	life	is	typically	100).

<negative>
This	is	yet	another	key	advantage	of	VUL	over	Whole	Life.

With	a	typical	whole	life	policy,	the	death	benefit	is	limited	to	the	face	amount	specified	in	the	policy,	and	at	endowment	age,	the	face	amount	is	all	that	is	paid	out.
</negative>
<negative>
Thus	with	either	death	or	endowment,	the	insurance	company	keeps	any	cash	value	built	up	over	the	years.
</negative>
<negative>
However,	some	participating	whole	life	policies	offer	riders	which	specify	that	any	dividends	paid	on	the	policy	be	used	to	purchase	"paid	up	additions"	to	the	policy	which	increase	both	the	cash	value	and	the	death	benefit	over	time.

The	g-force	acceleration	acts	as	a	multiplier	of	weight-like	forces	for	every	unit	of	an	object's	mass,	and	(save	for	certain	electromagnetic	force	influences)	is	the	cause	of	an	object's	acceleration	in	relation	to	free-fall	.

Thus,	the	standard	gravitational	acceleration	at	the	Earth's	surface	produces	g-force	only	indirectly,	as	a	result	of	resistance	to	it	by	mechanical	forces.

<negative>
The	1	g-force	on	an	object	sitting	on	the	Earth's	surface	is	caused	by	mechanical	force	exerted	in	the	upward	direction	by	the	ground	,	keeping	the	object	from	going	into	free-fall.

<negative>
The	upward	force	from	the	ground	ensures	that	an	object	at	rest	on	the	Earth's	surface	is	accelerating	relative	to	the	free-fall	condition,	which	is	the	path	that	the	object	would	follow	when	falling	freely	toward	the	Earth's	center.

<negative>
Objects	allowed	to	free-fall	in	an	inertial	trajectory	under	the	influence	of	gravitation-only,	feel	no	g-force.

This	is	demonstrated	by	the	"zero-g"	conditions	inside	a	freely	falling	elevator	falling	toward	the	Earth's	center	(in	vacuum),	or	(to	good	approximation)	conditions	inside	a	spacecraft	in	Earth	orbit.

The	experience	of	no	g-force	(zero-g),	however	it	is	produced,	is	synonymous	with	weightlessness	.

In	the	absence	of	gravitational	fields,	or	in	directions	at	right	angles	to	them,	proper	and	coordinate	accelerations	are	the	same,	and	any	coordinate	acceleration	must	be	produced	by	a	corresponding	g-force	acceleration.

The	slope	of	a	roof	is	properly	known	as	its	pitch:	Roofs	which	are	nearly	flat	are	known	as	low-pitch	roofs	(as	the	angle	of	slope	increases,	so	the	pitch	is	said	to	increase).
</negative>
<negative>
Any	sheet	of	material	used	to	cover	a	flat	or	low-pitched	roof	is	usually	known	as	a	membrane	and	the	primary	purpose	of	these	membranes	is	to	waterproof	the	roof	area.

Water	from	some	flat	roofs	such	as	on	garden	sheds	sometimes	flows	freely	off	the	edge	of	a	roof,	though	gutter	systems	are	of	advantage	in	keeping	both	walls	and	foundations	dry.

The	tar	or	tarpaper	is	in	turn	covered	in	gravel	to	keep	the	sun's	heat,	UV	rays	and	weather	off	it	and	helps	protect	it	from	cracking	or	blistering	and	degradation.

</negative>
<negative>
A	main	reason	for	failure	of	these	traditional	roofs	is	ignorance	or	lack	of	maintenance	where	people	or	events	cause	the	gravel	to	be	moved	or	removed	from	the	tar	or	tarpaper	waterproofing,	thus	exposing	it	to	weather	and	sun	whereupon	cracking	and	blistering	occurs	over	time	and	eventually	water	gets	in.

Tarpaper	is	usually	a	'paper'	or	fibre	material	soaked	or	impregnated	in	tar.

As	gravel	cannot	protect	tarpaper	surfaces	where	they	rise	vertically	from	the	roof	such	as	on	parapet	walls	or	upstands,	tarpaper	variants	are	produced	with	fine	gravel	applied	to	the	hot	tar	during	the	process	of	manufacture	such	that	a	permanent	layer	of	gravel	is	stuck	to	it	in	order	to	give	it	ongoing	protection.

If	a	leak	does	occur	on	a	flat	roof	then	damage	often	goes	unnoticed	for	long	periods	of	time	during	which	water	penetrates	and	soaks	the	decking	and	any	insulation	and/or	structure	beneath	it.

This	can	lead	to	expensive	damage	from	the	rot	which	often	develops	and	if	left	can	weaken	the	roof	structure.

One	problem	with	maintaining	flat	roofs	is	that	if	water	does	penetrate	the	barrier	covering	(be	it	traditional	or	a	modern	membrane)	it	can	travel	a	long	way	before	causing	visible	damage	or	leaking	into	a	building	where	it	can	be	seen.
</negative>
<negative>
Thus	it	is	not	easy	to	see	where	it	is	leaking	in	order	to	repair	it.

Once	underlying	roof	decking	is	soaked	it	often	sags	causing	a	further	collection	or	puddling	of	water	in	that	area	and	the	problem	worsens.

Events	involving	meiosis,	showing	chromosomal	crossover
</negative>
<negative>
Meiosis	()	is	a	special	type	of	cell	division	necessary	for	sexual	reproduction	in	eukaryotes	.
</negative>
<negative>
The	cells	produced	by	meiosis	are	gametes	or	spores	.
</negative>
<negative>
In	many	organisms,	including	all	animals	and	land	plants	(but	not	some	other	groups	such	as	fungi	),	gametes	are	called	sperm	and	egg	cells	.
</negative>
<negative>
Whilst	the	process	of	meiosis	bears	a	number	of	similarities	with	the	'life-cycle'	cell	division	process	of	mitosis	,	it	differs	in	two	important	respects:
</negative>
<negative>
the	chromosomes	in	meiosis	undergo	a	recombination	which	shuffles	the	genes	producing	a	different	genetic	combination	in	each	gamete,	compared	with	the	co-existence	of	each	of	the	two	separate	pairs	of	each	chromosome	(one	received	from	each	parent)	in	each	cell	which	results	from	mitosis.
</negative>
<negative>
the	outcome	of	meiosis	is	potentially	four	(genetically	unique)	haploid	cells,	compared	with	the	two	(genetically	identical)	diploid	cells	produced	from	mitosis.
</negative>
<negative>
Meiosis	begins	with	one	diploid	cell	containing	two	copies	of	each	chromosome	—one	from	the	organism's	mother	and	one	from	its	father.
</negative>
<negative>
The	cell	divides	twice,	potentially	producing	up	to	four	haploid	cells	containing	one	copy	of	each	chromosome.
</negative>
<negative>
("Potentially"	because	in	some	cases,	such	as	the	formation	of	oocytes	in	mammals,	only	one	of	the	possible	four	haploid	cells	survives.)
</negative>
<negative>
In	animals	the	haploid	cell	resulting	from	meiosis	is	a	male	or	female	gamete	.
</negative>
<negative>
Each	of	the	resulting	chromosomes	in	the	gamete	cells	is	a	unique	mixture	of	maternal	and	paternal	DNA,	resulting	in	offspring	that	are	genetically	distinct	from	either	parent.
</negative>
<negative>
This	gives	rise	to	genetic	diversity	in	sexually	reproducing	populations.
</negative>
<negative>
This	genetic	diversity	can	provide	the	variation	of	physical	and	behavioural	attributes	(	phenotypes	)	upon	which	natural	selection	can	act,	but,	as	described	below	in	Section	6,	Origin	and	function	of	meiosis,	the	genetic	diversity	may	be	largely	a	by-product	of	the	homologous	recombination	that	is	primarily	employed	for	its	DNA	repair	function	during	meiosis.
</negative>
<negative>
It	is	also	noteworthy	that	during	meiosis,	specific	genes	are	more	highly	transcribed,	and	these	are	called	the	meiome,	the	term	used	in	functional	genomics	for	the	meiotic	transcriptome	.
</negative>
<negative>
Meiosis	is	a	key	feature	for	all	sexually	reproducing	eukaryotes	in	which	homologous	chromosome	pairing,	synapse	and	recombination	occur.
</negative>
<negative>
In	addition	to	strong	meiotic	stage-specific	expression	of	mRNA	(the	meiome),	however,	there	are	also	pervasive	translational	controls	(e.g.	selective	usage	of	preformed	mRNA),	regulating	the	ultimate	meiotic	stage-specific	protein	expression	of	genes	during	meiosis.
</negative>
<negative>
Thus,	both	the	meiome	and	translational	controls	determine	the	broad	restructuring	of	meiotic	cells	needed	to	carry	out	meiosis.
</negative>
<negative>
Prior	to	the	meiosis	process	the	cell's	chromosomes	are	duplicated	by	a	round	of	DNA	replication	,	creating	from	the	maternal	and	paternal	versions	of	each	chromosome	(	homologs	)	two	exact	copies,	sister	chromatids	,	attached	at	the	centromere	region.
</negative>
<negative>
In	the	beginning	of	meiosis	the	maternal	and	paternal	homologs	pair	to	each	other.
</negative>
<negative>
Then	they	typically	exchange	parts	by	homologous	recombination	leading	to	crossovers	of	DNA	between	the	maternal	and	paternal	versions	of	the	chromosome.
</negative>
<negative>
Spindle	fibers	bind	to	the	centromeres	of	each	pair	of	homologs	and	arrange	the	pairs	at	the	spindle	equator.
</negative>
<negative>
Then	the	fibers	pull	the	recombined	homologs	to	opposite	poles	of	the	cell.
</negative>
<negative>
As	the	chromosomes	move	away	from	the	center	the	cell	divides	into	two	daughter	cells,	each	containing	a	haploid	number	of	chromosomes	composed	of	two	chromatids.
</negative>
<negative>
After	the	recombined	maternal	and	paternal	homologs	have	separated	into	the	two	daughter	cells,	a	second	round	of	cell	division	occurs.
</negative>
<negative>
There	meiosis	ends	as	the	two	sister	chromatids	making	up	each	homolog	are	separated	and	move	into	one	of	the	four	resulting	gamete	cells.
</negative>
<negative>
Upon	fertilization	,	for	example	when	a	sperm	enters	an	egg	cell,	two	gamete	cells	produced	by	meiosis	fuse.
</negative>
<negative>
The	gamete	from	the	mother	and	the	gamete	from	the	father	each	contribute	one	half	of	the	set	of	chromosomes	that	make	up	the	new	offspring's	genome	.
</negative>
<negative>
Meiosis	uses	many	of	the	same	mechanisms	as	mitosis	,	a	type	of	cell	division	used	by	eukaryotes	like	plants	and	animals	to	split	one	cell	into	two	identical	daughter	cells.
</negative>
<negative>
In	all	plants	and	in	many	protists	meiosis	results	in	the	formation	of	spores	:	haploid	cells	that	can	divide	vegetatively	without	undergoing	fertilization.

For	example,	ascorbic	acid	(	vitamin	C	)	is	a	vitamin	for	humans,	but	not	for	most	other	animals,	and	biotin	and	vitamin	D	are	required	in	the	human	diet	only	in	certain	circumstances.

<negative>
Vitamins	have	diverse	biochemical	functions.

</negative>
<negative>
Others	function	as	antioxidants	(e.g.,	vitamin	E	and	sometimes	vitamin	C	).
</negative>
<negative>
The	largest	number	of	vitamins	(such	as	B	complex	vitamins)	function	as	precursors	for	enzyme	cofactors	,	that	help	enzymes	in	their	work	as	catalysts	in	metabolism	.
</negative>
<negative>
In	this	role,	vitamins	may	be	tightly	bound	to	enzymes	as	part	of	prosthetic	groups	:	For	example,	biotin	is	part	of	enzymes	involved	in	making	fatty	acids	.

Until	the	mid-1930s,	when	the	first	commercial	yeast-extract	vitamin	B	complex	and	semi-synthetic	vitamin	C	supplement	tablets	were	sold,	vitamins	were	obtained	solely	through	food	intake,	and	changes	in	diet	(which,	for	example,	could	occur	during	a	particular	growing	season)	usually	greatly	altered	the	types	and	amounts	of	vitamins	ingested.

The	relationship	between	percentage	changes	and	basis	points	can	be	summarized	as	follows:	1	percentage	point	change	=	100	basis	points,	and	0.01	percentage	points	=	1	basis	point.
</positive>
<negative>
A	basis	point	(often	denoted	as	bp,	colloquially	referred	to	in	the	plural	as	"bips",	also	known	as	a	"beep")	is	a	unit	equal	to	one	hundredth	of	a	percentage	point	,	or	one	part	per	ten	thousand	,	1/10000.
</negative>
<negative>
The	same	unit	is	also	(rarely)	called	a	permyriad,	literally	meaning	'for	(every)	myriad	(ten	thousand)',	and	in	that	context	is	written	with	which	looks	like	a	percent	sign	(%)	with	two	extra	zeroes	at	the	end	(like	a	stylized	form	of	the	four	zeros	in	the	denominator	,	although	it	originates	as	a	natural	extension	of	the	percent	(%)	and	permille	(‰)	signs).

</negative>
<negative>

</negative>
<negative>
Basis	points	are	used	as	a	convenient	unit	of	measurement	in	contexts	where	percentage	differences	of	less	than	1%	are	discussed.
</negative>
<negative>
The	most	common	example	is	interest	rates	,	where	differences	in	interest	rates	of	less	than	1%	per	year	are	usually	meaningful	to	talk	about.
</negative>
<negative>
For	example,	a	difference	of	0.10	percentage	points	is	equivalent	to	a	change	of	10	basis	points	(e.g.	a	4.67%	rate	increases	by	10	basis	points	to	4.77%).
</negative>
<negative>
Like	percentage	points	,	basis	points	avoid	the	ambiguity	between	relative	and	absolute	discussions	about	interest	rates	by	dealing	only	with	the	absolute	change	in	numeric	value	of	a	rate.
</negative>
<negative>
For	example,	if	a	report	says	there	has	been	a	"1%	increase"	from	a	10%	interest	rate,	this	could	refer	to	an	increase	either	from	10%	to	10.1%	(relative,	1%	of	10%),	or	from	10%	to	11%	(absolute,	1%	plus	10%).
</negative>
<negative>
If,	however,	the	report	says	there	has	been	a	"10	basis	point	increase"	from	a	10%	interest	rate,	then	we	know	that	the	interest	rate	of	10%	has	increased	by	0.10%	(the	absolute	change)	to	a	10.1%	rate.
</negative>
<negative>
It	is	common	practice	in	the	financial	industry	to	use	basis	points	to	denote	a	rate	change	in	a	financial	instrument	,	or	the	difference	(	spread	)	between	two	interest	rates,	including	the	yields	of	fixed-income	securities	.
</negative>
<negative>
Since	certain	loans	and	bonds	may	commonly	be	quoted	in	relation	to	some	index	or	underlying	security	,	they	will	often	be	quoted	as	a	spread	over	(or	under)	the	index.
</negative>
<negative>
For	example,	a	loan	that	bears	interest	of	0.50%	per	annum	above	the	London	Interbank	Offered	Rate	(LIBOR)	is	said	to	be	50	basis	points	over	LIBOR,	which	is	commonly	expressed	as	"L+50bps"	or	simply	"L+50".
</negative>
<negative>
The	term	"basis	point"	has	its	origins	in	trading	the	"basis"	or	the	spread	between	two	interest	rates.
</negative>
<negative>
Since	the	basis	is	usually	small,	these	are	quoted	multiplied	up	by	10000,	and	hence	a	"full	point"	movement	in	the	"basis"	is	a	basis	point.
</negative>
<negative>
Contrast	with	pips	in	FX	forward	markets.
</negative>
<negative>
So,	a	bond	whose	yield	increases	from	5%	to	5.5%	is	said	to	increase	by	50	basis	points;	or	interest	rates	that	have	risen	1	percentage	point	are	said	to	have	increased	by	100	basis	points.

<negative>
A	port	is	associated	with	an	IP	address	of	the	host,	as	well	as	the	type	of	protocol	used	for	communication.

<negative>
The	purpose	of	ports	is	to	uniquely	identify	different	applications	or	processes	running	on	a	single	computer	and	thereby	enable	them	to	share	a	single	physical	connection	to	a	packet-switched	network	like	the	Internet	.

In	economics	,	the	money	supply	or	money	stock,	is	the	total	amount	of	monetary	assets	available	in	an	economy	at	a	specific	time.

Some	heterodox	economists	argue	that	the	money	supply	is	endogenous	(determined	by	the	workings	of	the	economy,	not	by	the	central	bank)	and	that	the	sources	of	inflation	must	be	found	in	the	distributional	structure	of	the	economy.

In	addition,	those	economists	seeing	the	central	bank	's	control	over	the	money	supply	as	feeble	say	that	there	are	two	weak	links	between	the	growth	of	the	money	supply	and	the	inflation	rate.
</negative>
<negative>
First,	in	the	aftermath	of	a	recession,	when	many	resources	are	underutilized,	an	increase	in	the	money	supply	can	cause	a	sustained	increase	in	real	production	instead	of	inflation.

what	are	rocker	arms?
</question>

Generally	referred	to	within	the	context	of	the	internal	combustion	engine	of	automotive,	marine,	motorcycle	and	reciprocating	aviation	engines,	the	rocker	arm	is	an	oscillating	lever	that	conveys	radial	movement	from	the	cam	lobe	into	linear	movement	at	the	poppet	valve	to	open	it.

<negative>
Rocker	arm
</negative>
<negative>
One	end	is	raised	and	lowered	by	a	rotating	lobe	of	the	camshaft	(either	directly	or	via	a	tappet	(lifter)	and	pushrod	)	while	the	other	end	acts	on	the	valve	stem	.
</negative>
<negative>
When	the	camshaft	lobe	raises	the	outside	of	the	arm,	the	inside	presses	down	on	the	valve	stem,	opening	the	valve.
</negative>
<negative>
When	the	outside	of	the	arm	is	permitted	to	return	due	to	the	camshafts	rotation,	the	inside	rises,	allowing	the	valve	spring	to	close	the	valve.

<negative>
Friction	may	be	reduced	at	the	point	of	contact	with	the	valve	stem	by	a	roller	cam	follower	.
</negative>
<negative>
A	similar	arrangement	transfers	the	motion	via	another	roller	cam	follower	to	a	second	rocker	arm.
</negative>
<negative>
This	rotates	about	the	rocker	shaft,	and	transfers	the	motion	via	a	tappet	to	the	poppet	valve	.
</negative>
<negative>
In	this	case	this	opens	the	intake	valve	to	the	cylinder	head	.
</negative>
<negative>
The	effective	leverage	of	the	arm	(and	thus	the	force	it	can	exert	on	the	valve	stem)	is	determined	by	the	rocker	arm	ratio,	the	ratio	of	the	distance	from	the	rocker	arm's	center	of	rotation	to	the	tip	divided	by	the	distance	from	the	center	of	rotation	to	the	point	acted	on	by	the	camshaft	or	pushrod.
</negative>
<negative>
Current	automotive	design	favors	rocker	arm	ratios	of	about	1.5:1	to	1.8:1.
</negative>
<negative>
However,	in	the	past	smaller	positive	ratios	(the	valve	lift	is	greater	than	the	cam	lift)	and	even	negative	ratios	(valve	lift	smaller	than	the	cam	lift)	have	been	used.
</negative>
<negative>
Many	pre-WW2	engines	use	1:1	(neutral)	ratios.

<negative>
For	car	engines	the	rocker	arms	are	generally	steel	stampings	,	providing	a	reasonable	balance	of	strength,	weight	and	economical	cost.
</negative>
<negative>
Because	the	rocker	arms	are,	in	part,	reciprocating	weight	,	excessive	mass	especially	at	the	lever	ends	limits	the	engine's	ability	to	reach	high	operating	speeds.

<negative>
It	has	gained	in	popularity	in	recent	years	as	a	more	distinctive	alternative	to	the	more	popular	round	brilliant	cut	,	in	which	the	top	of	diamond,	called	the	crown,	is	cut	with	a	round	face-up	shape	and	the	bottom,	called	the	pavilion,	is	shaped	similar	to	a	cone	.
</negative>
<negative>
A	princess	cut	with	the	same	width	as	the	diameter	of	a	round	brilliant	will	weigh	more	as	it	has	four	corners	which	would	otherwise	have	been	cut	off	and	rounded	to	form	a	round	brilliant.

The	Princess	cut	had	its	origins	in	the	early	"French"	cut,	having	a	step-modified	"Double-French"	or	"Cross"	cut	crown	and	a	series	of	unique,	chevron-shaped	facets	in	the	pavilion	which	combine	to	give	a	distinct	cross-shaped	reflection	when	the	stone	is	viewed	directly	through	the	table.

what	are	stocks	and	bonds
</question>
<positive>
In	finance	,	a	bond	is	an	instrument	of	indebtedness	of	the	bond	issuer	to	the	holders.
</positive>
<positive>
Bonds	and	stocks	are	both	securities	,	but	the	major	difference	between	the	two	is	that	(capital)	stockholders	have	an	equity	stake	in	the	company	(i.e.	they	are	owners),	whereas	bondholders	have	a	creditor	stake	in	the	company	(i.e.	they	are	lenders).
</positive>
<negative>
It	is	a	debt	security	,	under	which	the	issuer	owes	the	holders	a	debt	and,	depending	on	the	terms	of	the	bond,	is	obliged	to	pay	them	interest	(the	coupon	)	or	to	repay	the	principal	at	a	later	date,	termed	the	maturity	.
</negative>
<negative>
Interest	is	usually	payable	at	fixed	intervals	(semiannual,	annual,	sometimes	monthly).
</negative>
<negative>
Very	often	the	bond	is	negotiable,	i.e.	the	ownership	of	the	instrument	can	be	transferred	in	the	secondary	market.
</negative>
<negative>
Thus	a	bond	is	a	form	of	loan	or	IOU	:	the	holder	of	the	bond	is	the	lender	(creditor),	the	issuer	of	the	bond	is	the	borrower	(debtor),	and	the	coupon	is	the	interest.
</negative>
<negative>
Bonds	provide	the	borrower	with	external	funds	to	finance	long-term	investments	,	or,	in	the	case	of	government	bonds	,	to	finance	current	expenditure.
</negative>
<negative>
Certificates	of	deposit	(CDs)	or	short	term	commercial	paper	are	considered	to	be	money	market	instruments	and	not	bonds:	the	main	difference	is	in	the	length	of	the	term	of	the	instrument.
</negative>
<negative>
Another	difference	is	that	bonds	usually	have	a	defined	term,	or	maturity,	after	which	the	bond	is	redeemed,	whereas	stocks	may	be	outstanding	indefinitely.
</negative>
<negative>
An	exception	is	an	irredeemable	bond,	such	as	Consols	,	which	is	a	perpetuity	,	i.e.	a	bond	with	no	maturity.

what	can	electrical	energy	be	transformed	into
</question>
<negative>
Energy	Transformation	in	Energy	Systems	Language
</negative>
<negative>
Energy	transformation	or	energy	conversion	is	the	process	of	changing	one	form	of	energy	to	another.
</negative>
<negative>
In	physics,	the	term	energy	describes	the	capacity	to	produce	certain	changes	within	a	system,	without	regard	to	limitations	in	transformation	imposed	by	Entropy	.
</negative>
<negative>
Changes	in	total	energy	of	systems	can	only	be	accomplished	by	adding	or	subtracting	energy	from	them,	as	energy	is	a	quantity	which	is	conserved,	according	to	the	first	law	of	thermodynamics	.
</negative>
<negative>
According	to	special	relativity	,	changes	in	the	energy	of	systems	will	also	coincide	with	changes	in	the	system's	mass	,	and	the	total	amount	of	mass	of	a	system	is	a	measure	of	its	energy.
</negative>
<negative>
Energy	in	a	system	may	be	transformed	so	that	it	resides	in	a	different	state,	or	a	different	type	of	energy.
</negative>
<negative>
Energy	in	many	states	may	be	used	to	do	many	varieties	of	physical	work.
</negative>
<negative>
Energy	may	be	used	in	natural	processes	or	machines,	or	else	to	provide	some	service	to	society	(such	as	heat,	light	,	or	motion	).
</negative>
<negative>
For	example,	an	internal	combustion	engine	converts	the	potential	chemical	energy	in	gasoline	and	oxygen	into	heat	,	which	is	then	transformed	into	the	propulsive	energy	(	kinetic	energy	that	moves	a	vehicle).
</negative>
<negative>
A	solar	cell	converts	solar	radiation	into	electrical	energy	that	can	then	be	used	to	light	a	bulb	or	power	a	computer.
</negative>
<negative>
The	generic	name	for	a	device	which	converts	energy	from	one	form	to	another,	is	a	transducer	.
</negative>
<negative>
In	general,	most	types	of	energy,	save	for	thermal	energy,	may	be	converted	efficiently	to	any	other	kind	of	energy.
</negative>
<negative>
Sometimes	this	occurs	with	an	efficiency	of	essentially	100%,	such	as	when	potential	energy	is	converted	to	kinetic	energy	as	an	object	falls	in	vacuum,	or	when	it	orbits	nearer	or	farther	from	another	object,	in	space.
</negative>
<negative>
Conversion	of	other	types	of	energies	to	heat	may	also	occurs	with	nearly	perfect	efficiency	(many	types	of	friction	do	this).
</negative>
<negative>
Exceptions	for	perfect	conversion	efficiency	(even	for	isolated	systems)	occur	when	energy	has	already	been	partly	distributed	among	many	available	quantum	states	for	a	collection	of	particles,	which	are	freely	allowed	to	explore	any	state	of	momentum	and	position	(	phase	space	).
</negative>
<negative>
In	such	circumstances,	a	measure	called	Entropy	,	or	evening-out	of	energy	distribution	in	such	states,	dictates	that	future	states	of	the	system	must	be	of	at	least	equal	evenness	in	energy	distribution.
</negative>
<negative>
(There	is	no	way,	taking	the	universe	as	a	whole,	to	collect	energy	into	fewer	states,	once	it	has	spread	to	them).
</negative>
<negative>
A	consequence	of	this	requirement	is	that	there	are	limitations	to	the	efficiency	with	which	thermal	energy	can	be	converted	to	other	kinds	of	energy,	since	thermal	energy	in	equilibrium	at	a	given	temperature	already	represents	the	maximal	evening-out	of	energy	between	all	possible	states.
</negative>
<negative>
Such	energy	is	sometimes	considered	"degraded	energy,"	because	it	is	not	entirely	usable.
</negative>
<negative>
The	second	law	of	thermodynamics	is	a	way	of	stating	that,	for	this	reason,	thermal	energy	in	a	system	may	be	converted	to	other	kinds	of	energy	with	efficiencies	approaching	100%,	only	if	the	entropy	(even-ness	or	disorder)	of	the	universe	is	increased	by	other	means,	to	compensate	for	the	decrease	in	entropy	associated	with	the	disappearance	of	the	thermal	energy	and	its	entropy	content.
</negative>
<negative>
Otherwise,	only	a	part	of	thermal	energy	may	be	converted	to	other	kinds	of	energy	(and	thus,	useful	work),	since	the	remainder	of	the	heat	must	be	reserved	to	be	transferred	to	a	thermal	reservoir	at	a	lower	temperature,	in	such	a	way	that	the	increase	in	Entropy	for	this	process	more	than	compensates	for	the	entropy	decrease	associated	with	transformation	of	the	rest	of	the	heat	into	other	types	of	energy.

Additionally,	in	the	United	States,	an	MFA	is	recognized	as	a	terminal	degree	for	practitioners	of	Visual	Art,	Design,	Dance,	Theatre,	Film/Video,	New	Media,	and	Creative	Writing	-	meaning	that	it	is	considered	to	be	the	highest	degree	in	its	field,	and	is	used	as	a	minimum	qualification	to	be	able	to	apply	to	become	a	Full-Time	Professor	teaching	at	the	University	level	in	these	disciplines.
</negative>
<negative>
There	are	exceptions	to	this	standard	in	the	Arts,	notably	in	the	case	of	music	performance,	where	the	MFA	is	not	seen	as	a	terminal	degree	in	the	context	of	the	more	standardized	DMA	degree.

It	is	also	critical	to	note	that	in	the	interest	of	extending	the	connection	between	creative	production	and	continued	academic	research	,	some	universities	have	established	practice-based	Ph.D	programs	in	fields	such	as	creative	writing	,	visual	arts	,	new	media	,	design	and	theater	.
</negative>
<negative>
While	this	has	had	an	effect	in	Creative	Writing,	and	to	a	lesser	extent	in	design	and	new	media,	the	influx	of	graduates	from	practice-based	PhD	programs	has	not	appreciably	changed	the	standard	for	the	MFA	as	the	terminal	degree	in	most	Arts	disciplines	yet.

</question>
<positive>
The	causes	of	World	War	I	,	which	began	in	central	Europe	in	late	July	1914	and	finished	in	1918,	included	many	factors,	such	as	the	conflicts	and	hostility	of	the	four	decades	leading	up	to	the	war.
</positive>
<negative>
Personifications	of	Germany,	France,	Russia,	Austria-Hungary,	and	the	United	Kingdom	attempting	to	keep	the	lid	on	the	simmering	cauldron	of	imperialist	and	nationalist	tensions	in	the	Balkans	to	prevent	a	general	European	war.
</negative>
<negative>
They	were	successful	in	1912	and	1913	but	did	not	succeed	in	in	1914.
</negative>
<negative>
Militarism	,	alliances	,	imperialism	,	and	nationalism	played	major	roles	in	the	conflict	as	well.
</negative>
<negative>
The	immediate	origins	of	the	war,	however,	lay	in	the	decisions	taken	by	statesmen	and	generals	during	the	Crisis	of	1914	,	casus	belli	for	which	was	the	assassination	of	Archduke	Franz	Ferdinand	(the	Archduke	of	Austria	Hungary)	and	his	wife	Sophie	by	Gavrilo	Princip	,	an	irredentist	Serb	.
</negative>
<negative>
The	crisis	came	after	a	long	and	difficult	series	of	diplomatic	clashes	between	the	Great	Powers	(Italy,	France,	Germany,	the	British	Empire,	the	Austria-Hungarian	Empire	and	Russia)	over	European	and	colonial	issues	in	the	decade	before	1914	that	had	left	tensions	high.
</negative>
<negative>
In	turn	these	diplomatic	clashes	can	be	traced	to	changes	in	the	balance	of	power	in	Europe	since	1867.
</negative>
<negative>
The	more	immediate	cause	for	the	war	was	tensions	over	territory	in	the	Balkans	.
</negative>
<negative>
Austria-Hungary	competed	with	Serbia	and	Russia	for	territory	and	influence	in	the	region	and	they	pulled	the	rest	of	the	Great	Powers	into	the	conflict	through	their	various	alliances	and	treaties.
</negative>
<negative>
Although	the	chain	of	events	unleashed	by	the	assassination	triggered	the	war,	the	war's	origins	go	deeper,	involving	national	politics,	cultures,	economics,	and	a	complex	web	of	alliances	and	counterbalances	that	had	developed	between	the	various	European	powers	since	1870.
</negative>
<negative>
Some	of	the	most	important	long	term	or	structural	causes	are:	the	growth	of	nationalism	across	Europe,	unresolved	territorial	disputes,	an	intricate	system	of	alliances,	the	perceived	breakdown	of	the	balance	of	power	in	Europe,	convoluted	and	fragmented	governance,	the	arms	races	of	the	previous	decades,	previous	military	planning,	imperial	and	colonial	rivalry	for	wealth,	power	and	prestige,	and	economic	and	military	rivalry	in	industry	and	trade	–	e.g.,	the	Pig	War	between	Austria	and	Serbia.
</negative>
<negative>
Other	causes	that	came	into	play	during	the	diplomatic	crisis	that	preceded	the	war	included	misperceptions	of	intent	(e.g.,	the	German	belief	that	the	United	Kingdom	would	remain	neutral)	and	delays	and	misunderstandings	in	diplomatic	communications.

The	various	categories	of	explanation	for	World	War	I	correspond	to	different	historians'	overall	methods	.

Most	historians	and	popular	commentators	include	causes	from	more	than	one	category	of	explanation	to	provide	a	rounded	account	of	the	causes	of	the	war.
</negative>
<negative>
The	deepest	distinction	among	these	accounts	is	between	stories	that	see	it	as	the	inevitable	and	predictable	outcome	of	certain	factors,	and	those	that	describe	it	as	an	arbitrary	and	unfortunate	mistake.
</negative>
<negative>
In	attributing	causes	for	the	war,	historians	and	academics	had	to	deal	with	an	unprecedented	flood	of	memoirs	and	official	documents,	released	as	each	country	involved	tried	to	avoid	blame	for	starting	the	war.
</negative>

Early	releases	of	information	by	governments,	particularly	those	released	for	use	by	the	"Commission	on	the	Responsibility	of	the	Authors	of	the	War"	were	shown	to	be	incomplete	and	biased.

Ozone	depletion	describes	two	distinct	but	related	phenomena	observed	since	the	late	1970s:	a	steady	decline	of	about	4%	per	decade	in	the	total	volume	of	ozone	in	Earth	's	stratosphere	(the	ozone	layer	),	and	a	much	larger	springtime	decrease	in	stratospheric	ozone	over	Earth's	polar	regions.

Self-esteem	is	a	disposition	that	a	person	has	which	represents	their	judgements	of	their	own	worthiness.
</negative>
<negative>
In	the	mid-1960s,	Morris	Rosenberg	and	social-learning	theorists	defined	self-esteem	as	a	personal	worth	or	worthiness.
</negative>
<negative>
Nathaniel	Branden	in	1969	defined	self-esteem	as	"the	experience	of	being	competent	to	cope	with	the	basic	challenges	of	life	and	being	worthy	of	happiness."
</negative>
<negative>
According	to	Branden,	self-esteem	is	the	sum	of	self-confidence	(a	feeling	of	personal	capacity)	and	self-respect	(a	feeling	of	personal	worth).
</negative>
<negative>
It	exists	as	a	consequence	of	the	implicit	judgement	that	every	person	has	of	their	ability	to	face	life's	challenges,	to	understand	and	solve	problems,	and	their	right	to	achieve	happiness	,	and	be	given	respect.
</negative>
<negative>
As	a	social	psychological	construct,	self-esteem	is	attractive	because	researchers	have	conceptualized	it	as	an	influential	predictor	of	relevant	outcomes,	such	as	academic	achievement	(Marsh	1990)	or	exercise	behavior	(Hagger	et	al.	1998).
</negative>
<negative>
In	addition,	self-esteem	has	also	been	treated	as	an	important	outcome	due	to	its	close	relation	with	psychological	well-being	(Marsh	1989).
</negative>
<negative>
Self-esteem	can	apply	specifically	to	a	particular	dimension	(for	example,	"I	believe	I	am	a	good	writer	and	I	feel	happy	about	that")	or	a	global	extent	(for	example,	"I	believe	I	am	a	bad	person,	and	feel	bad	about	myself	in	general").
</negative>
<negative>
Psychologists	usually	regard	self-esteem	as	an	enduring	personality	characteristic	("trait"	self-esteem),	though	normal,	short-term	variations	("state"	self-esteem)	also	exist.

The	term	"bounds"	refers	to	a	more	general	boundary	description,	such	as	along	a	certain	watercourse,	a	stone	wall,	an	adjoining	public	road	way,	or	an	existing	building.
</negative>
<negative>
The	system	is	often	used	to	define	larger	pieces	of	property	(e.g.	farms),	and	political	subdivisions	(e.g.	town	boundaries)	where	precise	definition	is	not	required	or	would	be	far	too	expensive,	or	previously	designated	boundaries	can	be	incorporated	into	the	description.

what	form	of	decay	does	not	change	the	atomic	number	of	them	decaying	atom?
</question>

Alpha	decay	is	one	example	type	of	radioactive	decay,	in	which	an	atomic	nucleus	emits	an	alpha	particle	,	and	thereby	transforms	(or	'decays')	into	an	atom	with	a	mass	number	4	less	and	atomic	number	2	less.
</negative>

Radioactive	decay,	also	known	as	nuclear	decay	or	radioactivity,	is	the	process	by	which	a	nucleus	of	an	unstable	atom	loses	energy	by	emitting	particles	of	ionizing	radiation	.
</negative>
<negative>
A	material	that	spontaneously	emits	this	kind	of	radiation	—	which	includes	the	emission	of	energetic	alpha	particles	,	beta	particles	,	and	gamma	rays	—	is	considered	radioactive.
</negative>
<negative>
There	are	many	different	types	of	radioactive	decay	(see	table	below).
</negative>
<negative>
A	decay,	or	loss	of	energy,	results	when	an	atom	with	one	type	of	nucleus,	called	the	parent	radionuclide	,	transforms	to	an	atom	with	a	nucleus	in	a	different	state,	or	to	a	different	nucleus	containing	different	numbers	of	protons	and	neutrons	.
</negative>
<negative>
Either	of	these	products	is	named	the	daughter	nuclide.
</negative>
<negative>
In	some	decays	the	parent	and	daughter	are	different	chemical	elements	,	and	thus	the	decay	process	results	in	nuclear	transmutation	(creation	of	an	atom	of	a	new	element).
</negative>
<negative>
The	first	decay	processes	to	be	discovered	were	alpha	decay	,	beta	decay	,	and	gamma	decay	.
</negative>
<negative>
Alpha	decay	occurs	when	the	nucleus	ejects	an	alpha	particle	(helium	nucleus).
</negative>
<negative>
This	is	the	most	common	process	of	emitting	nucleons	,	but	in	rarer	types	of	decays,	nuclei	can	eject	protons	,	or	specific	nuclei	of	other	elements	(in	the	process	called	cluster	decay	).
</negative>
<negative>
Beta	decay	occurs	when	the	nucleus	emits	an	electron	or	positron	and	a	type	of	neutrino	,	in	a	process	that	changes	a	proton	to	a	neutron	or	the	other	way	around.
</negative>
<negative>
The	nucleus	may	capture	an	orbiting	electron,	converting	a	proton	into	a	neutron	(	electron	capture	).
</negative>
<negative>
All	of	these	processes	result	in	nuclear	transmutation.
</negative>
<negative>
By	contrast,	there	exist	radioactive	decay	processes	that	do	not	result	in	transmutation.
</negative>
<negative>
The	energy	of	an	excited	nucleus	may	be	emitted	as	a	gamma	ray	in	gamma	decay,	or	used	to	eject	an	orbital	electron	by	interaction	with	the	excited	nucleus	in	a	process	called	internal	conversion	.
</negative>

Radioisotopes	occasionally	emit	neutrons,	and	this	results	in	a	change	in	an	element	from	one	isotope	to	another.

One	type	of	radioactive	decay	results	in	products	which	are	not	defined,	but	appear	in	a	range	of	"pieces"	of	the	original	nucleus.
</negative>
<negative>
This	decay	is	called	spontaneous	fission	.
</negative>
<negative>
This	decay	happens	when	a	large	unstable	nucleus	spontaneously	splits	into	two	(and	occasionally	three)	smaller	daughter	nuclei,	and	usually	emits	gamma	rays,	neutrons,	or	other	particles	as	a	consequence.
</negative>
<negative>
Radioactive	decay	is	a	stochastic	(i.e.,	random)	process	at	the	level	of	single	atoms,	in	that,	according	to	quantum	theory	,	it	is	impossible	to	predict	when	a	particular	atom	will	decay.
</negative>
<negative>
However,	the	chance	that	a	given	atom	will	decay	is	constant	over	time.
</negative>
<negative>
For	a	large	number	of	atoms,	the	decay	rate	for	the	collection	is	computable	from	the	measured	decay	constants	of	the	nuclides	(or	equivalently	from	the	half-lifes	).

Lapping	is	a	machining	process,	in	which	two	surfaces	are	rubbed	together	with	an	abrasive	between	them,	by	hand	movement	or	by	way	of	a	machine.
</positive>
<negative>
This	can	take	two	forms.
</negative>
<negative>
The	first	type	of	lapping	(traditionally	called	grinding	),	typically	involves	rubbing	a	brittle	material	such	as	glass	against	a	surface	such	as	iron	or	glass	itself	(also	known	as	the	"lap"	or	grinding	tool)	with	an	abrasive	such	as	aluminum	oxide	,	jeweller's	rouge	,	optician's	rouge	,	emery	,	silicon	carbide	,	diamond	,	etc.,	in	between	them.
</negative>
<negative>
This	produces	microscopic	conchoidal	fractures	as	the	abrasive	rolls	about	between	the	two	surfaces	and	removes	material	from	both.

what	is	darwin's	origin	of	species
</question>
<negative>
On	the	Origin	of	Species,	published	on	24	November	1859,	is	a	work	of	scientific	literature	by	Charles	Darwin	which	is	considered	to	be	the	foundation	of	evolutionary	biology	.
</negative>

<negative>
For	the	sixth	edition	of	1872,	the	short	title	was	changed	to	The	Origin	of	Species.

<negative>
Darwin's	book	introduced	the	scientific	theory	that	populations	evolve	over	the	course	of	generations	through	a	process	of	natural	selection	.
</negative>
<negative>
It	presented	a	body	of	evidence	that	the	diversity	of	life	arose	by	common	descent	through	a	branching	pattern	of	evolution	.
</negative>
<negative>
Darwin	included	evidence	that	he	had	gathered	on	the	Beagle	expedition	in	the	1830s	and	his	subsequent	findings	from	research,	correspondence,	and	experimentation.
</negative>
<negative>
Various	evolutionary	ideas	had	already	been	proposed	to	explain	new	findings	in	biology	.
</negative>
<negative>
There	was	growing	support	for	such	ideas	among	dissident	anatomists	and	the	general	public,	but	during	the	first	half	of	the	19th	century	the	English	scientific	establishment	was	closely	tied	to	the	Church	of	England	,	while	science	was	part	of	natural	theology	.
</negative>
<negative>
Ideas	about	the	transmutation	of	species	were	controversial	as	they	conflicted	with	the	beliefs	that	species	were	unchanging	parts	of	a	designed	hierarchy	and	that	humans	were	unique,	unrelated	to	other	animals.
</negative>
<negative>
The	political	and	theological	implications	were	intensely	debated,	but	transmutation	was	not	accepted	by	the	scientific	mainstream.
</negative>
<negative>
The	book	was	written	for	non-specialist	readers	and	attracted	widespread	interest	upon	its	publication.
</negative>
<negative>
As	Darwin	was	an	eminent	scientist,	his	findings	were	taken	seriously	and	the	evidence	he	presented	generated	scientific,	philosophical,	and	religious	discussion.
</negative>
<negative>
The	debate	over	the	book	contributed	to	the	campaign	by	T.H.	Huxley	and	his	fellow	members	of	the	X	Club	to	secularise	science	by	promoting	scientific	naturalism	.
</negative>
<negative>
Within	two	decades	there	was	widespread	scientific	agreement	that	evolution,	with	a	branching	pattern	of	common	descent,	had	occurred,	but	scientists	were	slow	to	give	natural	selection	the	significance	that	Darwin	thought	appropriate.
</negative>
<negative>
During	the	"	eclipse	of	Darwinism	"	from	the	1880s	to	the	1930s,	various	other	mechanisms	of	evolution	were	given	more	credit.
</negative>
<negative>
With	the	development	of	the	modern	evolutionary	synthesis	in	the	1930s	and	1940s,	Darwin's	concept	of	evolutionary	adaptation	through	natural	selection	became	central	to	modern	evolutionary	theory,	now	the	unifying	concept	of	the	life	sciences	.

<question>
what	is	peat	moss	good	for	growing?
</question>
<negative>
Sphagnum	is	a	genus	of	between	1510	and	3500	species	of	mosses	,	commonly	called	peat	moss	due	to	its	prevalence	in	wet	habitats	where	it	contributes	to	the	formation	of	peat	bogs	and	mires.
</negative>
<negative>
Sphagnum	accumulations	can	store	water,	since	both	living	and	dead	plants	can	hold	large	quantities	of	water	inside	their	cells;	plants	may	hold	from	16-26	times	as	much	water	as	their	dry	weight	depending	on	the	species.
</negative>
<negative>
The	empty	cells	help	retain	water	in	drier	conditions.
</negative>
<negative>
Hence,	as	sphagnum	moss	grows,	it	can	slowly	spread	into	drier	conditions,	forming	larger	peatlands,	both	raised	bogs	and	blanket	bogs.
</negative>
<negative>
These	peat	accumulations	then	provide	habitat	for	a	wide	array	of	peatland	plants,	including	sedges	and	ericaceous	shrubs,	as	well	as	orchids	and	carnivorous	plants.
</negative>
<negative>
Sphagnum	and	the	peat	formed	from	it	do	not	decay	readily	because	of	the	phenolic	compounds	embedded	in	the	moss's	cell	walls	.
</negative>
<negative>
In	addition,	bogs,	like	all	wetlands,	develop	anaerobic	soil	conditions,	which	produces	slower	anaerobic	decay	rather	than	aerobic	microbial	action.
</negative>
<negative>
Peat	moss	can	also	acidify	its	surroundings	by	taking	up	cations	,	such	as	calcium	and	magnesium	,	and	releasing	hydrogen	ions.
</negative>
<negative>
Under	the	right	conditions,	peat	can	accumulate	to	a	depth	of	many	meters.
</negative>
<negative>
Different	species	of	Sphagnum	have	different	tolerance	limits	for	flooding	and	pH,	so	any	one	peatland	may	have	a	number	of	different	Sphagnum	species.
</negative>
<negative>
Individual	peat	moss	plants	consist	of	a	main	stem,	with	tightly	arranged	clusters	of	branch	fascicles	usually	consisting	of	two	or	three	spreading	branches	and	two	to	four	hanging	branches.
</negative>
<negative>
The	top	of	the	plant,	or	capitulum,	has	compact	clusters	of	young	branches.
</negative>
<negative>
Along	the	stem	are	scattered	leaves	of	various	shapes,	named	stem	leaves;	the	shape	varies	according	to	species.
</negative>
<negative>
The	leaves	consist	of	two	kinds	of	cells;	small,	green,	living	cells	(	chlorophyllose	cells),	and	large,	clear,	structural,	dead	cells	(	hyaline	cells).

Cnidaria	(	with	a	silent	c)	or	Coelenterata	is	a	phylum	containing	over	10,000	species	of	animals	found	exclusively	in	aquatic	and	mostly	marine	environments.

Their	bodies	consist	of	mesoglea	,	a	non-living	jelly-like	substance,	sandwiched	between	two	layers	of	epithelium	that	are	mostly	one	cell	thick	.
</negative>
<negative>
They	have	two	basic	body	forms:	swimming	medusae	and	sessile	polyps	,	both	of	which	are	radially	symmetrical	with	mouths	surrounded	by	tentacles	that	bear	cnidocytes.
</negative>
<negative>
Both	forms	have	a	single	orifice	and	body	cavity	that	are	used	for	digestion	and	respiration	.

Many	have	complex	lifecycles	with	asexual	polyp	stages	and	sexual	medusae,	but	some	omit	either	the	polyp	or	the	medusa	stage.
</negative>
<negative>
Cnidarians	were	for	a	long	time	grouped	with	Ctenophores	in	the	phylum	Coelenterata	,	but	increasing	awareness	of	their	differences	caused	them	to	be	placed	in	separate	phyla.
</negative>
<negative>
Cnidarians	are	classified	into	four	main	groups:	the	almost	wholly	sessile	Anthozoa	(	sea	anemones	,	corals	,	sea	pens	);	swimming	Scyphozoa	(jellyfish);	Cubozoa	(box	jellies);	and	Hydrozoa	,	a	diverse	group	that	includes	all	the	freshwater	cnidarians	as	well	as	many	marine	forms,	and	has	both	sessile	members	such	as	Hydra	and	colonial	swimmers	such	as	the	Portuguese	Man	o'	War	.
</negative>
<negative>
Staurozoa	have	recently	been	recognised	as	a	class	in	their	own	right	rather	than	a	sub-group	of	Scyphozoa,	and	there	is	debate	about	whether	Myxozoa	and	Polypodiozoa	are	cnidarians	or	closer	to	bilaterians	(more	complex	animals).
</negative>
<negative>
Most	cnidarians	prey	on	organisms	ranging	in	size	from	plankton	to	animals	several	times	larger	than	themselves,	but	many	obtain	much	of	their	nutrition	from	endosymbiotic	algae	,	and	a	few	are	parasites	.

</negative>
<negative>
While	corals	are	almost	entirely	restricted	to	warm,	shallow	marine	waters,	other	cnidarians	live	in	the	depths,	in	polar	seas	and	in	freshwater.

<negative>
Fossil	cnidarians	have	been	found	in	rocks	formed	about	,	and	other	fossils	show	that	corals	may	have	been	present	shortly	before	and	diversified	a	few	million	years	later.
</negative>
<negative>
Fossils	of	cnidarians	that	do	not	build	mineralized	structures	are	very	rare.

<negative>
Scientists	currently	think	that	cnidarians,	ctenophores	and	bilaterians	are	more	closely	related	to	calcareous	sponges	than	these	are	to	other	sponges	,	and	that	anthozoans	are	the	evolutionary	"aunts"	or	"sisters"	of	other	cnidarians,	and	the	most	closely	related	to	bilaterians.

what	is	rationalism	by	john	locke	george	berkeley
</question>
<negative>
George	Berkeley	(;	12	March	168514	January	1753),	also	known	as	Bishop	Berkeley	(	Bishop	of	Cloyne	),	was	an	Anglo-Irish	philosopher	whose	primary	achievement	was	the	advancement	of	a	theory	he	called	"immaterialism"	(later	referred	to	as	"	subjective	idealism	"	by	others).
</negative>
<negative>
This	theory	denies	the	existence	of	material	substance	and	instead	contends	that	familiar	objects	like	tables	and	chairs	are	only	ideas	in	the	minds	of	perceivers	,	and	as	a	result	cannot	exist	without	being	perceived.
</negative>
<negative>
Thus,	as	Berkeley	famously	put	it,	for	physical	objects	"esse	est	percipi"	("	to	be	is	to	be	perceived	").
</negative>
<negative>
Berkeley	is	also	known	for	his	critique	of	abstraction	,	an	important	premise	in	his	argument	for	immaterialism.
</negative>
<negative>
In	1709,	Berkeley	published	his	first	major	work,	,	in	which	he	discussed	the	limitations	of	human	vision	and	advanced	the	theory	that	the	proper	objects	of	sight	are	not	material	objects,	but	light	and	colour.
</negative>
<negative>
This	foreshadowed	his	chief	philosophical	work	A	Treatise	Concerning	the	Principles	of	Human	Knowledge	in	1710	which,	after	its	poor	reception,	he	rewrote	in	dialogue	form	and	published	under	the	title	Three	Dialogues	between	Hylas	and	Philonous	in	1713.
</negative>
<negative>
In	this	book,	Berkeley's	views	were	represented	by	Philonous	(Greek:	'lover	of	mind'),	while	Hylas	(Greek:	'matter')	embodies	the	Irish	thinker’s	opponents,	in	particular	John	Locke	.

His	arguments	were	a	precursor	to	the	views	of	Mach	and	Einstein	.
</negative>
<negative>
In	1732,	he	published	Alciphron	,	a	Christian	apologetic	against	the	free-thinkers	,	and	in	1734,	he	published	The	Analyst	,	an	empiricist	critique	of	the	foundations	of	infinitesimal	calculus	,	which	was	influential	in	the	development	of	mathematics.
</negative>
<negative>
His	last	major	philosophical	work,	Siris	(1744),	begins	by	advocating	the	medicinal	use	of	tar	water	,	and	then	continues	to	discuss	a	wide	range	of	topics	including	science,	philosophy,	and	theology.
</negative>
<negative>
Interest	in	Berkeley's	work	increased	after	World	War	II,	because	he	tackled	many	of	the	issues	of	paramount	interest	to	philosophy	in	the	20th	century	such	as	the	problems	of	perception,	the	difference	between	primary	and	secondary	qualities,	and	the	importance	of	language.

<negative>
It	had	no	existence	under	the	English	common	law	,	being	created	by	2	Geo.	II	c.	22	for	the	relief	of	insolvent	debtors,	although	set-off	was	recognized	in	equity	.
</negative>
<negative>
Such	a	defense	could	be	pleaded	only	in	respect	of	mutual	debts	of	a	definite	character,	and	did	not	apply	to	cases	in	which	damages	were	claimed,	nor	to	equitable	claims	or	demands.
</negative>

By	the	rules	of	the	Supreme	Court	(O.	XIX.	r.	3)	a	defendant	in	an	action	may	set	off	or	set	up	any	right	or	claim	by	way	of	counterclaim	against	the	claims	of	a	plaintiff,	and	such	set-off	or	counterclaim	has	the	same	effect	as	a	statement	of	claim	in	a	cross-action.
</negative>
<negative>
The	legal	defense	of	set-off	(above)	was	originally	introduced	to	prevent	the	unfair	situation	whereby	a	person	("Party	A")	who	owed	money	to	another	("Party	B")	could	be	sent	to	debtors	prison,	despite	the	fact	that	Party	B	also	owed	money	to	Party	A.

The	law	thus	allows	both	parties	to	defer	payment	until	their	respective	claims	have	been	heard	in	court.
</negative>
<negative>
Upon	judgment,	both	claims	are	extinguished	and	replaced	by	a	single	net	sum	owing	(e.g.	If	Party	A	owes	Party	B	100	and	Party	B	owes	Party	A	105,	the	two	sums	are	set	off	and	replaced	with	a	single	obligation	of	5	from	Party	B	to	Party	A).

Set-off	can	also	be	incorporated	by	contractual	agreement	so	that,	where	a	party	defaults,	the	mutual	amounts	owing	are	automatically	set	off	and	extinguished.

<negative>
In	certain	jurisdictions	(including	the	UK),	set-off	takes	place	automatically	upon	the	insolvency	of	a	company.
</negative>
<negative>
This	means	that,	for	each	party	which	is	both	a	creditor	and	debtor	of	the	insolvent	company,	mutual	debts	are	set-off	against	each	other,	and	then	either	the	bankrupt's	creditor	can	claim	the	balance	in	the	bankruptcy	or	the	trustee	in	bankruptcy	can	ask	for	the	balance	remaining	to	be	paid,	depending	on	which	side	owed	the	most.

what	is	scurvy	disease
</question>
<positive>
Scurvy	is	a	disease	resulting	from	a	deficiency	of	vitamin	C	,	which	is	required	for	the	synthesis	of	collagen	in	humans.
</positive>
<negative>
The	chemical	name	for	vitamin	C,	ascorbic	acid,	is	derived	from	the	Latin	name	of	scurvy,	scorbutus,	which	also	provides	the	adjective	scorbutic	("of,	characterized	by	or	having	to	do	with	scurvy").
</negative>
<negative>
Scurvy	often	presents	itself	initially	as	symptoms	of	malaise	and	lethargy,	followed	by	formation	of	spots	on	the	skin,	spongy	gums,	and	bleeding	from	the	mucous	membranes	.
</negative>

As	scurvy	advances,	there	can	be	open,	suppurating	wounds,	loss	of	teeth,	jaundice,	fever,	neuropathy	and	death.
</negative>
<negative>
Scurvy	was	at	one	time	common	among	sailors	,	pirates	and	others	aboard	ships	at	sea	longer	than	perishable	fruits	and	vegetables	could	be	stored	(subsisting	instead	only	on	cured	and	salted	meats	and	dried	grains	)	and	by	soldiers	similarly	deprived	of	these	foods	for	extended	periods.

<negative>
It	was	described	by	Hippocrates	(c.	460	BC–c.	380	BC),	and	herbal	cures	for	scurvy	have	been	known	in	many	native	cultures	since	prehistory.

While	today	scurvy	is	known	to	be	caused	by	a	nutritional	deficiency,	until	the	isolation	of	vitamin	C	and	direct	evidence	of	its	link	to	scurvy	in	1932,	numerous	theories	and	treatments	were	proposed,	often	on	little	or	no	experimental	data.
</negative>
<negative>
This	inconsistency	is	attributed	to	the	lack	of	vitamin	C	as	a	distinct	concept,	an	inability	to	reliably	link	different	foods	(notably	present	in	fresh	citrus,	watercress,	and	organ	meat)	to	scurvy.
</negative>
<negative>
An	additional	concept	required	to	understand	scurvy	was	the	degradation	of	vitamin	C	by	exposure	to	air	and	copper	and	other	transition	metal	salts	such	as	those	of	iron,	thus	changing	the	links	of	foods	to	scurvy	over	time.

<negative>
Thermal	comfort	is	the	condition	of	mind	that	expresses	satisfaction	with	the	thermal	environment	and	is	assessed	by	subjective	evaluation(	ANSI	/	ASHRAE	Standard	55).
</negative>
<negative>
Maintaining	this	standard	of	thermal	comfort	for	occupants	of	buildings	or	other	enclosures	is	one	of	the	important	goals	of	HVAC	(	heating	,	ventilation	,	and	air	conditioning	)	design	engineers.
</negative>
<negative>
The	Predicted	Mean	Vote	(PMV)	model	stands	among	the	most	recognized	thermal	comfort	models.
</negative>
<negative>
It	was	developed	using	principles	of	heat	balance	and	experimental	data	collected	in	a	controlled	climate	chamber	under	steady	state	conditions.
</negative>
<negative>
Because	the	PMV	model	was	derived	from	data	collected	in	a	controlled	climate,	it	is	not	suitable	for	applications	in	naturally	ventilated	spaces	which	often	have	high	levels	of	air	movement.
</negative>
<negative>
This	shortcoming	motivated	the	development	of	a	family	of	empirical	statistical	models	of	thermal	comfort	in	naturally	ventilated	spaces	known	as	adaptive	models.
</negative>
<negative>
Adaptive	models	of	thermal	comfort	consider	occupants	as	dynamically	interacting	with	their	environment,	and	controlling	their	thermal	comfort	by	means	of	clothing	or	window-opening	and	closing.
</negative>
<negative>
This	is	in	contrast	to	thermal	comfort	in	sealed	buildings,	in	which	occupants	experience	the	environment	passively.
</negative>
<negative>
Thermal	comfort	is	affected	by	heat	conduction	,	convection	,	radiation	,	and	evaporative	heat	loss	.
</negative>
<negative>
Thermal	comfort	is	maintained	when	the	heat	generated	by	human	metabolism	is	allowed	to	dissipate,	thus	maintaining	thermal	equilibrium	with	the	surroundings.

</negative>
<negative>
To	find	the	enthalpy	change	per	mole	of	a	substance	A	in	a	reaction	between	two	substances	A	and	B,	the	substances	are	added	to	a	calorimeter	and	the	initial	and	final	temperatures	(before	the	reaction	started	and	after	it	has	finished)	are	noted.
</negative>
<negative>
Multiplying	the	temperature	change	by	the	mass	and	specific	heat	capacities	of	the	substances	gives	a	value	for	the	energy	given	off	or	absorbed	during	the	reaction.
</negative>
<negative>
Dividing	the	energy	change	by	how	many	moles	of	A	were	present	gives	its	enthalpy	change	of	reaction.

what	is	the	meaning	of	reimbursement
</question>

In	an	insurance	policy,	the	deductible	is	the	amount	of	expenses	that	must	be	paid	out	of	pocket	before	an	insurer	will	pay	any	expenses.

<negative>
In	general	usage,	the	term	deductible	may	be	used	to	describe	one	of	several	types	of	clauses	(see	below)	that	are	used	by	insurance	companies	as	a	threshold	for	policy	payments.

<negative>
By	restricting	its	coverage	to	events	that	are	significant	enough	to	incur	large	costs,	the	insurance	firm	expects	to	pay	out	slightly	smaller	amounts	much	less	frequently,	incurring	much	higher	savings.

</negative>

One	of	the	most	well-known	and	heavily	studied	hotspots	in	the	world,	the	Hawaii	plume	is	responsible	for	the	creation	of	the	Hawaiian	–	Emperor	seamount	chain	,	an	over	5,800	kilometres	(3,600	mi)	long	chain	of	volcanoes,	four	of	which	are	active	,	two	of	which	are	dormant	,	and	more	than	123	of	which	are	extinct	,	many	having	since	been	ground	beneath	the	waves	by	erosion	as	seamounts	and	atolls	.

The	chain	extends	from	south	of	the	island	of	Hawaii	to	the	edge	of	the	Aleutian	Trench	,	near	the	eastern	edge	of	Russia	.
</negative>
<negative>
While	most	volcanoes	are	created	by	geological	activity	at	tectonic	plate	boundaries,	the	Hawaii	hotspot	is	located	far	from	nearby	plate	boundaries;	the	classic	hotspot	theory,	first	proposed	in	1963	by	John	Tuzo	Wilson	,	proposes	that	a	single,	fixed	mantle	plume	builds	volcanoes	that	then,	cut	off	from	their	source	by	the	movement	of	the	Pacific	Plate	,	become	increasingly	inactive	and	eventually	erode	below	sea	level	over	millions	of	years.
</negative>
<negative>
According	to	this	theory,	the	nearly	60°	bend	separating	the	Emperor	and	Hawaiian	segments	of	the	chain	was	caused	by	a	sudden	shift	in	the	movement	of	the	Pacific	Plate.
</negative>
<negative>
In	2003,	fresh	investigations	of	this	irregularity	led	to	the	proposal	of	a	mobile	hotspot	theory,	suggesting	that	hotspots	are	mobile,	not	fixed,	and	that	the	47	million	year	old	bend	was	caused	by	a	shift	in	the	hotspot's	motion	rather	than	the	plate's.
</negative>
<negative>
Ancient	Hawaiians	were	the	first	to	recognize	the	increasing	age	and	weathered	state	of	the	volcanoes	to	the	north	as	they	progressed	on	fishing	expeditions	along	the	islands.

After	the	arrival	of	Europeans	on	the	island,	in	1880-1881	James	Dwight	Dana	directed	the	first	formal	geological	study	of	the	hotspot's	volcanics,	confirming	the	relationship	long	observed	by	the	natives.

</negative>
<negative>
Cholecalciferol	(vitamin	D3)	and	ergocalciferol	(vitamin	D2)	are	unique	as	they	constitute	what	we	know	as	vitamin	D	and	can	be	ingested	from	the	diet	and/or	supplements.

<negative>
The	body	can	also	synthesize	vitamin	D	(from	cholesterol)	when	sun	exposure	is	adequate	(hence	its	nickname,	the	"sunshine	vitamin").
</negative>
<negative>
Although	vitamin	D	is	commonly	called	a	vitamin,	it	is	not	actually	an	essential	dietary	vitamin	in	the	strict	sense,	as	it	can	be	synthesized	in	adequate	amounts	by	most	mammals	exposed	to	sunlight.

<negative>
(Cats	and	dogs	cannot	synthesize	vitamin	D	efficiently	and	must	receive	it	in	their	diet.)

An	organic	chemical	compound	(or	related	set	of	compounds)	is	only	scientifically	called	a	vitamin	when	it	cannot	be	synthesized	in	sufficient	quantities	by	an	organism,	and	must	be	obtained	from	their	diet.
</negative>
<negative>
However,	as	with	other	compounds	commonly	called	vitamins,	vitamin	D	was	discovered	in	an	effort	to	find	the	dietary	substance	that	was	lacking	in	a	disease,	namely,	rickets	,	the	childhood	form	of	osteomalacia	.

Measures	of	serum	levels	reflect	endogenous	synthesis	from	exposure	to	sunlight	as	well	as	intake	from	the	diet,	and	it	is	believed	that	synthesis	may	contribute	generally	to	the	maintenance	of	adequate	serum	concentrations.
</negative>
<negative>
The	evidence	indicates	that	the	synthesis	of	vitamin	D	from	sun	exposure	works	in	a	feedback	loop	that	prevents	toxicity	but,	because	of	uncertainty	about	the	cancer	risk	from	sunlight,	no	recommendations	are	issued	by	the	Institute	of	Medicine	,	USA,	for	the	amount	of	sun	exposure	required	to	meet	vitamin	D	requirements.
</negative>
<negative>
Accordingly,	the	Dietary	Reference	Intakes	for	vitamin	D	assume	that	no	synthesis	occurs	and	that	all	of	a	person's	vitamin	D	is	from	their	diet,	although	that	will	rarely	occur	in	practice.

</negative>
<negative>
Part	of	the	calcidiol	is	converted	by	the	kidneys	to	calcitriol	,	the	biologically	active	form	of	vitamin	D.	Calcitriol	circulates	as	a	hormone	in	the	blood,	regulating	the	concentration	of	calcium	and	phosphate	in	the	bloodstream	and	promoting	the	healthy	growth	and	remodeling	of	bone.

Calcidiol	is	also	converted	to	calcitriol	outside	of	the	kidneys	for	other	purposes,	such	as	the	proliferation,	differentiation	and	apoptosis	of	cells;	calcitriol	also	affects	neuromuscular	function	and	inflammation.

what	kind	of	potential	is	created	after	a	neuron	is	excited
</question>

A	neuron	(	or	;	also	known	as	a	neurone	or	nerve	cell)	is	an	electrically	excitable	cell	that	processes	and	transmits	information	through	electrical	and	chemical	signals.
</negative>
<negative>
A	chemical	signal	occurs	via	a	synapse	,	a	specialized	connection	with	other	cells.
</negative>
<negative>
Neurons	connect	to	each	other	to	form	neural	networks	.
</negative>
<negative>
Neurons	are	the	core	components	of	the	nervous	system	,	which	includes	the	brain	,	spinal	cord	,	and	peripheral	ganglia	.
</negative>
<negative>
A	number	of	specialized	types	of	neurons	exist:	sensory	neurons	respond	to	touch,	sound,	light	and	numerous	other	stimuli	affecting	cells	of	the	sensory	organs	that	then	send	signals	to	the	spinal	cord	and	brain.
</negative>
<negative>
Motor	neurons	receive	signals	from	the	brain	and	spinal	cord,	cause	muscle	contractions	,	and	affect	glands	.
</negative>
<negative>
Interneurons	connect	neurons	to	other	neurons	within	the	same	region	of	the	brain	or	spinal	cord.
</negative>
<negative>
A	typical	neuron	possesses	a	cell	body	(often	called	the	soma	),	dendrites	,	and	an	axon	.
</negative>
<negative>
Dendrites	are	thin	structures	that	arise	from	the	cell	body,	often	extending	for	hundreds	of	micrometres	and	branching	multiple	times,	giving	rise	to	a	complex	"dendritic	tree".
</negative>
<negative>
An	axon	is	a	special	cellular	extension	that	arises	from	the	cell	body	at	a	site	called	the	axon	hillock	and	travels	for	a	distance,	as	far	as	1	meter	in	humans	or	even	more	in	other	species.
</negative>
<negative>
The	cell	body	of	a	neuron	frequently	gives	rise	to	multiple	dendrites,	but	never	to	more	than	one	axon,	although	the	axon	may	branch	hundreds	of	times	before	it	terminates.
</negative>
<negative>
At	the	majority	of	synapses,	signals	are	sent	from	the	axon	of	one	neuron	to	a	dendrite	of	another.
</negative>
<negative>
There	are,	however,	many	exceptions	to	these	rules:	neurons	that	lack	dendrites,	neurons	that	have	no	axon,	synapses	that	connect	an	axon	to	another	axon	or	a	dendrite	to	another	dendrite,	etc.
</negative>
<negative>
All	neurons	are	electrically	excitable,	maintaining	voltage	gradients	across	their	membranes	by	means	of	metabolically	driven	ion	pumps	,	which	combine	with	ion	channels	embedded	in	the	membrane	to	generate	intracellular-versus-extracellular	concentration	differences	of	ions	such	as	sodium	,	potassium	,	chloride	,	and	calcium	.
</negative>
<negative>
Changes	in	the	cross-membrane	voltage	can	alter	the	function	of	voltage-dependent	ion	channels	.
</negative>
<negative>
If	the	voltage	changes	by	a	large	enough	amount,	an	all-or-none	electrochemical	pulse	called	an	action	potential	is	generated,	which	travels	rapidly	along	the	cell's	axon,	and	activates	synaptic	connections	with	other	cells	when	it	arrives.
</negative>
<negative>
Neurons	do	not	undergo	cell	division	.

<negative>
In	most	cases,	neurons	are	generated	by	special	types	of	stem	cells	.

In	humans,	neurogenesis	largely	ceases	during	adulthood—but	in	two	brain	areas,	the	hippocampus	and	olfactory	bulb	,	there	is	strong	evidence	for	generation	of	substantial	numbers	of	new	neurons.

The	American	Civil	War	(ACW),	also	known	as	the	War	between	the	States	or	simply	the	Civil	War	(see	naming	),	was	a	civil	war	fought	from	1861	to	1865	between	the	United	States	(the	"Union"	or	the	"North")	and	several	Southern	slave	states	that	declared	their	secession	and	formed	the	Confederate	States	of	America	(the	"Confederacy"	or	the	"South").

Earthquake	prediction	"is	usually	defined	as	the	specification	of	the	time,	location,	and	magnitude	of	a	future	earthquake	within	stated	limits",	and	particularly	of	"the	next	strong	earthquake	to	occur	in	a	region."

This	can	be	distinguished	from	earthquake	forecasting,	which	is	the	probabilistic	assessment	of	general	earthquake	hazard,	including	the	frequency	and	magnitude	of	damaging	earthquakes,	in	a	given	area	over	periods	of	years	or	decades.
</negative>
<negative>
This	can	be	further	distinguished	from	real-time	earthquake	warning	systems	,	which,	upon	detection	of	a	severe	earthquake,	can	provide	neighboring	regions	a	few	seconds	warning	of	potentially	significant	shaking.
</negative>
<negative>
To	be	useful,	an	earthquake	prediction	must	be	precise	enough	to	warrant	the	cost	of	increased	precautions,	including	disruption	of	ordinary	activities	and	commerce,	and	timely	enough	that	preparation	can	be	made.

Predictions	must	also	be	reliable,	as	false	alarms	and	cancelled	alarms	are	not	only	economically	costly,	but	seriously	undermine	confidence	in,	and	thereby	the	effectiveness	of,	any	kind	of	warning.
</negative>
<negative>
With	over	7,000	earthquakes	around	the	world	each	year	with	a	magnitude	of	4.0	or	greater,	trivial	success	in	earthquake	prediction	is	easily	obtained	using	sufficiently	broad	parameters	of	time,	location,	or	magnitude.

Major	earthquakes	are	often	followed	by	reports	that	they	were	predicted,	or	at	least	anticipated,	but	no	claim	of	a	successful	prediction	of	a	major	earthquake	has	survived	close	inquiry.

In	the	1970s	there	was	intense	optimism	amongst	scientists	that	some	method	of	predicting	earthquakes	might	be	found,	but	by	the	1990s	continuing	failure	led	many	scientists	to	question	whether	it	was	even	possible.

what	role	do	ombudsman	play	in	the	swedish	government?

An	ombudsman	is	an	official,	usually	appointed	by	the	government	or	by	parliament	but	with	a	significant	degree	of	independence,	who	is	charged	with	representing	the	interests	of	the	public	by	investigating	and	addressing	complaints	of	maladministration	or	violation	of	rights.

Scaled	to	the	size	of	that	population,	per	unit	of	time.
</negative>
<negative>
Mortality	rate	is	typically	expressed	in	units	of	deaths	per	1000	individuals	per	year;	thus,	a	mortality	rate	of	9.5	(out	of	1000)	in	a	population	of	1,000	would	mean	9.5	deaths	per	year	in	that	entire	population,	or	0.95%	out	of	the	total.

<negative>
It	is	distinct	from	morbidity	rate	,	which	refers	to	the	number	of	individuals	in	poor	health	during	a	given	time	period	(the	prevalence	rate	)	or	the	number	of	newly	appearing	cases	of	the	disease	per	unit	of	time	(	incidence	rate	).

<negative>
The	late	mortality	rate,	the	total	number	of	deaths	in	the	late	stages	of	an	ongoing	treatment,	or	a	significant	length	of	time	after	an	acute	treatment.
</negative>
<negative>
Note	that	the	crude	death	rate	as	defined	above	and	applied	to	a	whole	population	can	give	a	misleading	impression.

The	number	of	deaths	per	1000	people	can	be	higher	for	developed	nations	than	in	less-developed	countries,	despite	life	expectancy	being	higher	in	developed	countries	due	to	standards	of	health	being	better.
</negative>
<negative>
This	happens	because	developed	countries	typically	have	a	completely	different	population	age	distribution,	with	a	much	higher	proportion	of	older	people,	due	to	both	lower	recent	birth	rates	and	lower	mortality	rates.

In	the	1930s,	Keynes	spearheaded	a	revolution	in	economic	thinking,	overturning	the	older	ideas	of	neoclassical	economics	that	held	that	free	markets	would,	in	the	short	to	medium	term,	automatically	provide	full	employment,	as	long	as	workers	were	flexible	in	their	wage	demands.

Keynes's	influence	waned	in	the	1970s,	partly	as	a	result	of	problems	that	began	to	afflict	the	Anglo-American	economies	from	the	start	of	the	decade,	and	partly	because	of	critiques	from	Milton	Friedman	and	other	economists	who	were	pessimistic	about	the	ability	of	governments	to	regulate	the	business	cycle	with	fiscal	policy.

Postmodern	works	are	seen	as	a	reaction	against	Enlightenment	thinking	and	Modernist	approaches	to	literature	.
</negative>
<negative>
Postmodern	literature,	like	postmodernism	as	a	whole,	tends	to	resist	definition	or	classification	as	a	"	movement"	.
</negative>
<negative>
Indeed,	the	convergence	of	postmodern	literature	with	various	modes	of	critical	theory	,	particularly	reader-response	and	deconstructionist	approaches,	and	the	subversions	of	the	implicit	contract	between	author,	text	and	reader	by	which	its	works	are	often	characterised,	have	led	to	pre-modern	fictions	such	as	Cervantes	'	Don	Quixote	(1605,1615)	and	Laurence	Sterne	's	eighteenth-century	satire	Tristram	Shandy	being	retrospectively	inducted	into	the	fold.
</negative>
<negative>
While	there	is	little	consensus	on	the	precise	characteristics,	scope,	and	importance	of	postmodern	literature,	as	is	often	the	case	with	artistic	movements,	postmodern	literature	is	commonly	defined	in	relation	to	a	precursor.
</negative>
<negative>
For	example,	a	postmodern	literary	work	tends	not	to	conclude	with	the	neatly	tied-up	ending	as	is	often	found	in	modernist	literature,	but	often	parodies	it.

Postmodern	authors	tend	to	celebrate	chance	over	craft,	and	further	employ	metafiction	to	undermine	the	writer's	authority.

Another	characteristic	of	postmodern	literature	is	the	questioning	of	distinctions	between	high	and	low	culture	through	the	use	of	pastiche	,	the	combination	of	subjects	and	genres	not	previously	deemed	fit	for	literature.

Pain	and	suffering	is	the	legal	term	for	the	physical	and	emotional	stress	caused	from	an	injury	(see	also	pain	and	suffering	).

Some	damages	that	might	be	under	this	category	would	be:	aches,	temporary	and	permanent	limitations	on	activity,	potential	shortening	of	life,	depression	or	scarring	.

In	a	suit,	pain	and	suffering	is	part	of	the	"general	damages"	section	of	the	claimant's	claim,	or,	alternatively,	it	is	an	element	of	"compensatory"	non-economic	damages	that	allows	recovery	for	the	mental	anguish	and/or	physical	pain	endured	by	the	claimant	as	a	result	of	injury	for	which	the	plaintiff	seeks	redress.

</question>
<positive>
The	plum	pudding	model	of	the	atom	by	J.	J.	Thomson	,	who	discovered	the	electron	in	1897,	was	proposed	in	1904	before	the	discovery	of	the	atomic	nucleus	in	order	to	add	the	electron	to	the	atomic	model.
</positive>
<negative>
A	schematic	presentation	of	the	plum	pudding	model	of	the	atom	;	in	Thomson's	mathematical	model	the	"corpuscles"	(or	modern	electrons	)	were	arranged	non-randomly,	in	rotating	rings
</negative>
<negative>
The	current	model	of	the	sub-atomic	structure	involves	a	dense	nucleus	surrounded	by	a	probabilistic	"cloud"	of	electrons
</negative>
<negative>
In	this	model,	the	atom	is	composed	of	electrons	(which	Thomson	still	called	"corpuscles",	though	G.	J.	Stoney	had	proposed	that	atoms	of	electricity	be	called	electrons	in	1894)	surrounded	by	a	soup	of	positive	charge	to	balance	the	electrons'	negative	charges,	like	negatively	charged	"	plums	"	surrounded	by	positively	charged	"	pudding	".
</negative>
<negative>
The	electrons	(as	we	know	them	today)	were	thought	to	be	positioned	throughout	the	atom,	but	with	many	structures	possible	for	positioning	multiple	electrons,	particularly	rotating	rings	of	electrons	(see	below).
</negative>
<negative>
Instead	of	a	soup,	the	atom	was	also	sometimes	said	to	have	had	a	"cloud"	of	positive	charge.
</negative>
<negative>
With	this	model,	Thomson	abandoned	his	earlier	"nebular	atom"	hypothesis	in	which	the	atom	was	composed	of	immaterial	vortices.
</negative>
<negative>
Now,	at	least	part	of	the	atom	was	to	be	composed	of	Thomson's	particulate	negative	corpuscles,	although	the	rest	of	the	positively	charged	part	of	the	atom	remained	somewhat	nebulous	and	ill-defined.
</negative>
<negative>
The	1904	Thomson	model	was	disproved	by	the	1909	gold	foil	experiment	of	Hans	Geiger	and	Ernest	Marsden	.
</negative>
<negative>
This	was	interpreted	by	Ernest	Rutherford	in	1911

<negative>
to	imply	a	very	small	nucleus	of	the	atom	containing	a	very	high	positive	charge	(in	the	case	of	gold,	enough	to	balance	about	100	electrons),	thus	leading	to	the	Rutherford	model	of	the	atom.
</negative>
<negative>
Although	gold	has	an	atomic	number	of	79,	immediately	after	Rutherford's	paper	appeared	in	1911	Antonius	Van	den	Broek	made	the	intuitive	suggestion	that	atomic	number	is	nuclear	charge.

The	matter	required	experiment	to	decide.

Henry	Moseley	's	work	showed	experimentally	in	1913	(see	Moseley's	law	)	that	the	effective	nuclear	charge	was	very	close	to	the	atomic	number	(Moseley	found	only	one	unit	difference),	and	Moseley	referenced	only	the	papers	of	Van	den	Broek	and	Rutherford.

This	work	culminated	in	the	solar-system-like	(but	quantum-limited)	Bohr	model	of	the	atom	in	the	same	year,	in	which	a	nucleus	containing	an	atomic	number	of	positive	charge	is	surrounded	by	an	equal	number	of	electrons	in	orbital	shells.

In	Thomson's	view:	...	the	atoms	of	the	elements	consist	of	a	number	of	negatively	electrified	corpuscles	enclosed	in	a	sphere	of	uniform	positive	electrification,	...
</negative>
<negative>
In	this	model,	the	electrons	were	free	to	rotate	within	the	blob	or	cloud	of	positive	substance.
</negative>
<negative>
These	orbits	were	stabilized	in	the	model	by	the	fact	that	when	an	electron	moved	farther	from	the	center	of	the	positive	cloud,	it	felt	a	larger	net	positive	inward	force,	because	there	was	more	material	of	opposite	charge,	inside	its	orbit	(see	Gauss's	law	).
</negative>
<negative>
In	Thomson's	model,	electrons	were	free	to	rotate	in	rings	which	were	further	stabilized	by	interactions	between	the	electrons,	and	spectra	were	to	be	accounted	for	by	energy	differences	of	different	ring	orbits.
</negative>
<negative>
Thomson	attempted	to	make	his	model	account	for	some	of	the	major	spectral	lines	known	for	some	elements,	but	was	not	notably	successful	at	this.

Still,	Thomson's	model	(along	with	a	similar	Saturnian	ring	model	for	atomic	electrons	,	also	put	forward	in	1904	by	Nagaoka	after	James	Clerk	Maxwell	's	model	of	Saturn's	rings	),	were	earlier	harbingers	of	the	later	and	more	successful	solar-system-like	Bohr	model	of	the	atom.

If	the	Moon	were	in	a	perfectly	circular	orbit,	a	little	closer	to	the	Earth,	and	in	the	same	orbital	plane	,	there	would	be	total	solar	eclipses	every	single	month.
</negative>
<negative>
However,	the	Moon's	orbit	is	inclined	(tilted)	at	more	than	5	degrees	to	Earth's	orbit	around	the	Sun	(see	ecliptic	)	so	its	shadow	at	new	moon	usually	misses	Earth.
</negative>

Earth's	orbit	is	called	the	ecliptic	plane	as	the	Moon's	orbit	must	cross	this	plane	in	order	for	an	eclipse	(both	solar	as	well	as	lunar	)	to	occur.
</negative>
<negative>
In	addition,	the	Moon's	actual	orbit	is	elliptical,	often	taking	it	far	enough	away	from	Earth	that	its	apparent	size	is	not	large	enough	to	block	the	Sun	totally.

</negative>
<negative>
However,	total	solar	eclipses	are	rare	at	any	particular	location	because	totality	exists	only	along	a	narrow	path	on	Earth's	surface	traced	by	the	Moon's	shadow	or	umbra	.

In	the	fields	of	science	,	engineering	,	industry	,	and	statistics	,	the	accuracy	of	a	measurement	system	is	the	degree	of	closeness	of	measurements	of	a	quantity	to	that	quantity's	actual	(true)	value	.

<negative>
Although	the	two	words	reproducibility	and	repeatability	can	be	synonymous	in	colloquial	use,	they	are	deliberately	contrasted	in	the	context	of	the	scientific	method	.
</negative>
<negative>
A	measurement	system	can	be	accurate	but	not	precise,	precise	but	not	accurate,	neither,	or	both.

For	example,	if	an	experiment	contains	a	systematic	error	,	then	increasing	the	sample	size	generally	increases	precision	but	does	not	improve	accuracy.

In	addition	to	accuracy	and	precision,	measurements	may	also	have	a	measurement	resolution	,	which	is	the	smallest	change	in	the	underlying	physical	quantity	that	produces	a	response	in	the	measurement.

A	vaccination	schedule	is	a	series	of	vaccinations	,	including	the	timing	of	all	doses,	which	may	be	either	recommended	or	compulsory,	depending	on	the	country	of	residence.
</negative>
<negative>
A	vaccine	is	an	antigenic	preparation	used	to	produce	active	immunity	to	a	disease	,	in	order	to	prevent	or	reduce	the	effects	of	infection	by	any	natural	or	"wild"	pathogen	.
</negative>
<negative>
Many	vaccines	require	multiple	doses	for	maximum	effectiveness,	either	to	produce	sufficient	initial	immune	response	or	to	boost	response	that	fades	over	time.
</negative>
<negative>
For	example,	tetanus	vaccine	boosters	are	often	recommended	every	10	years.
</negative>
<negative>
Vaccine	schedules	are	developed	by	governmental	agencies	or	physicians	groups	to	achieve	maximum	effectiveness	using	required	and	recommended	vaccines	for	a	locality	while	minimizing	the	number	of	health	care	system	interactions.

<negative>
Sample	vaccinations	schedules	discussed	by	the	World	Health	Organization	show	a	developed	country	using	a	schedule	which	extends	over	the	first	five	years	of	a	child's	life	and	uses	vaccines	which	cost	over	$700	including	administration	costs	while	a	developing	country	uses	a	schedule	providing	vaccines	in	the	first	9	months	of	life	and	costing	only	$25.
</negative>
<negative>
This	difference	is	due	to	the	lower	cost	of	health	care,	the	lower	cost	of	many	vaccines	provided	to	developing	nations,	and	that	more	expensive	vaccines,	often	for	less	common	diseases,	are	not	utilized.

Before	the	introduction	of	postage	stamps,	mail	in	the	UK	was	paid	for	by	the	recipient,	a	system	that	was	associated	with	an	irresolvable	problem:	the	costs	of	delivering	mail	were	not	recoverable	by	the	postal	service	when	recipients	were	unable	or	unwilling	to	pay	for	delivered	items,	and	senders	had	no	incentive	to	restrict	the	number,	size,	or	weight	of	items	sent,	whether	or	not	they	would	ultimately	be	paid	for.

Later	related	inventions	include	postal	stationery	such	as	prepaid-postage	envelopes,	post	cards	,	lettercards	,	aerogrammes	and	wrappers	,	postage	meters	,	and,	more	recently,	specialty	boxes	and	envelopes	provided	free	to	the	customer	by	the	U.S.	postal	service	for	priority	or	express	mailing.

The	postage	stamp	afforded	convenience	for	both	the	mailer	and	postal	officials,	more	efficiently	recovered	costs	for	the	postal	service,	and	ultimately	resulted	in	a	better,	faster	postal	system.

<negative>
Flip-flops	(also	called	zōri	,	thongs,	jandals,	or	a	variety	of	other	names	throughout	the	world)	are	a	type	of	open-toed	sandal	typically	worn	in	casual	situations,	such	as	outside	or	at	the	beach.
</negative>
<negative>
They	consist	of	a	flat	sole	held	loosely	on	the	foot	by	a	Y-shaped	strap	that	passes	between	the	first	and	second	toes	and	around	either	side	of	the	foot.
</negative>
<negative>
They	may	also	be	held	to	the	foot	with	a	single	strap	over	the	front	of	the	foot	rather	than	a	thong.
</negative>
<negative>
The	name	"flip-flop"	originated	because	of	the	sound	that	is	made	by	slapping	between	the	sole	of	the	foot	and	the	floor	when	walking.
</negative>
<negative>
This	style	of	footwear	has	been	worn	by	the	people	of	many	cultures	throughout	the	world,	originating	as	early	as	the	ancient	Egyptians	in	4,000	B.C.

The	lack	of	support	provided	by	flip-flops	often	results	in	over-pronation	injuries,	caused	by	the	foot	slipping	inwards	further	than	normal.
</negative>
<negative>
This	can	lead	to	flat	feet	and	tendonitis	.
</negative>
<negative>
Other	injuries	that	may	result	are	due	to	the	footwear's	open-toed	nature,	such	as	stubbed	toes,	cuts,	and	bruises.

<negative>
Doctors	recommend	purchasing	pricier	sandals	with	thick-cushioned	soles,	as	well	as	those	that	have	a	strap	that	is	not	canvas	and	that	comes	back	almost	to	the	ankle.

The	most	familiar	example	is	a	voice	band	modem	that	turns	the	digital	data	of	a	personal	computer	into	modulated	electrical	signals	in	the	voice	frequency	range	of	a	telephone	channel.

<negative>
These	signals	can	be	transmitted	over	telephone	lines	and	demodulated	by	another	modem	at	the	receiver	side	to	recover	the	digital	data.
</negative>
<negative>
Modems	are	generally	classified	by	the	amount	of	data	they	can	send	in	a	given	unit	of	time	,	usually	expressed	in	bits	per	second	(bit/s,	or	bps),	or	bytes	per	second	(B/s).

<negative>
Modems	can	alternatively	be	classified	by	their	symbol	rate	,	measured	in	baud	.

The	baud	unit	denotes	symbols	per	second,	or	the	number	of	times	per	second	the	modem	sends	a	new	signal.

For	example,	the	ITU	V.21	standard	used	audio	frequency	shift	keying	with	two	possible	frequencies	corresponding	to	two	distinct	symbols	(or	one	bit	per	symbol),	to	carry	300	bits	per	second	using	300	baud.
</negative>
<negative>
By	contrast,	the	original	ITU	V.22	standard,	which	was	able	to	transmit	and	receive	four	distinct	symbols	(two	bits	per	symbol),	handled	1,200	bit/s	by	sending	600	symbols	per	second	(600	baud)	using	phase	shift	keying	.

The	Rosetta	Stone	is	an	ancient	Egyptian	granodiorite	stele	inscribed	with	a	decree	issued	at	Memphis	in	196	BC	on	behalf	of	King	Ptolemy	V	.

It	was	20	years,	however,	before	the	transliteration	of	the	Egyptian	scripts	was	announced	by	Jean-François	Champollion	in	Paris	in	1822;	it	took	longer	still	before	scholars	were	able	to	read	Ancient	Egyptian	inscriptions	and	literature	confidently.
</negative>
<negative>
Major	advances	in	the	decoding	were:	recognition	that	the	stone	offered	three	versions	of	the	same	text	(1799);	that	the	demotic	text	used	phonetic	characters	to	spell	foreign	names	(1802);	that	the	hieroglyphic	text	did	so	as	well,	and	had	pervasive	similarities	to	the	demotic	(	Thomas	Young	,	1814);	and	that,	in	addition	to	being	used	for	foreign	names,	phonetic	characters	were	also	used	to	spell	native	Egyptian	words	(Champollion,	1822–1824).
</negative>
<negative>
Two	other	fragmentary	copies	of	the	same	decree	were	discovered	later,	and	several	similar	Egyptian	bilingual	or	trilingual	inscriptions	are	now	known,	including	two	slightly	earlier	Ptolemaic	decrees	(the	Decree	of	Canopus	in	238	BC,	and	the	Memphis	decree	of	Ptolemy	IV	,	ca.	218	BC).

Although	vitamin	D	is	commonly	called	a	vitamin,	it	is	not	actually	an	essential	dietary	vitamin	in	the	strict	sense,	as	it	can	be	synthesized	in	adequate	amounts	by	most	mammals	exposed	to	sunlight.

However,	as	with	other	compounds	commonly	called	vitamins,	vitamin	D	was	discovered	in	an	effort	to	find	the	dietary	substance	that	was	lacking	in	a	disease,	namely,	rickets	,	the	childhood	form	of	osteomalacia	.

Measures	of	serum	levels	reflect	endogenous	synthesis	from	exposure	to	sunlight	as	well	as	intake	from	the	diet,	and	it	is	believed	that	synthesis	may	contribute	generally	to	the	maintenance	of	adequate	serum	concentrations.

The	evidence	indicates	that	the	synthesis	of	vitamin	D	from	sun	exposure	works	in	a	feedback	loop	that	prevents	toxicity	but,	because	of	uncertainty	about	the	cancer	risk	from	sunlight,	no	recommendations	are	issued	by	the	Institute	of	Medicine	,	USA,	for	the	amount	of	sun	exposure	required	to	meet	vitamin	D	requirements.

Accordingly,	the	Dietary	Reference	Intakes	for	vitamin	D	assume	that	no	synthesis	occurs	and	that	all	of	a	person's	vitamin	D	is	from	their	diet,	although	that	will	rarely	occur	in	practice.

Part	of	the	calcidiol	is	converted	by	the	kidneys	to	calcitriol	,	the	biologically	active	form	of	vitamin	D.	Calcitriol	circulates	as	a	hormone	in	the	blood,	regulating	the	concentration	of	calcium	and	phosphate	in	the	bloodstream	and	promoting	the	healthy	growth	and	remodeling	of	bone.

Diagram	showing	the	translation	of	mRNA	and	the	synthesis	of	proteins	by	a	ribosome
</negative>
<negative>
In	molecular	biology	and	genetics	,	translation	is	the	process	through	which	cellular	ribosomes	manufacture	proteins	.
</negative>
<negative>
It	is	part	of	the	process	of	gene	expression	.
</negative>
<negative>
In	translation,	messenger	RNA	(mRNA)	produced	by	transcription	is	decoded	by	the	ribosome	to	produce	a	specific	amino	acid	chain,	or	polypeptide	,	that	will	later	fold	into	an	active	protein.
</negative>
<negative>
In	bacteria,	translation	occurs	in	the	cell's	cytoplasm	,	where	the	large	and	small	subunits	of	the	ribosome	are	located,	and	bind	to	the	mRNA.
</negative>
<negative>
In	eukaryotes,	translation	occurs	across	the	membrane	of	the	endoplasmic	reticulum	in	a	process	called	vectorial	synthesis	.
</negative>
<negative>
The	ribosome	facilitates	decoding	by	inducing	the	binding	of	tRNAs	with	complementary	anticodon	sequences	to	that	of	the	mRNA.
</negative>
<negative>
The	tRNAs	carry	specific	amino	acids	that	are	chained	together	into	a	polypeptide	as	the	mRNA	passes	through	and	is	"read"	by	the	ribosome	in	a	fashion	reminiscent	to	that	of	a	stock	ticker	and	ticker	tape	.
</negative>
<negative>
In	many	instances,	the	entire	ribosome/mRNA	complex	binds	to	the	outer	membrane	of	the	rough	endoplasmic	reticulum	and	releases	the	nascent	protein	polypeptide	inside	for	later	vesicle	transport	and	secretion	outside	of	the	cell.
</negative>
<negative>
Many	types	of	transcribed	RNA,	such	as	transfer	RNA,	ribosomal	RNA,	and	small	nuclear	RNA,	do	not	undergo	translation	into	proteins.
</negative>
<negative>
Translation	proceeds	in	four	phases:	initiation,	elongation,	translocation	and	termination	(all	describing	the	growth	of	the	amino	acid	chain,	or	polypeptide	that	is	the	product	of	translation).
</negative>
<negative>
Amino	acids	are	brought	to	ribosomes	and	assembled	into	proteins.
</negative>
<negative>
In	activation,	the	correct	amino	acid	is	covalently	bonded	to	the	correct	transfer	RNA	(tRNA)	.
</negative>
<negative>
The	amino	acid	is	joined	by	its	carboxyl	group	to	the	3'	OH	of	the	tRNA	by	an	ester	bond	.
</negative>
<negative>
When	the	tRNA	has	an	amino	acid	linked	to	it,	it	is	termed	"charged".
</negative>
<negative>
Initiation	involves	the	small	subunit	of	the	ribosome	binding	to	the	5'	end	of	mRNA	with	the	help	of	initiation	factors	(IF).
</negative>
<negative>
Termination	of	the	polypeptide	happens	when	the	A	site	of	the	ribosome	faces	a	stop	codon	(UAA,	UAG,	or	UGA).
</negative>
<negative>
No	tRNA	can	recognize	or	bind	to	this	codon.
</negative>
<negative>
Instead,	the	stop	codon	induces	the	binding	of	a	release	factor	protein	that	prompts	the	disassembly	of	the	entire	ribosome/mRNA	complex.
</negative>
<negative>
A	number	of	antibiotics	act	by	inhibiting	translation;	these	include	anisomycin	,	cycloheximide	,	chloramphenicol	,	tetracycline	,	streptomycin	,	erythromycin	,	and	puromycin	,	among	others.
</negative>
<negative>
Prokaryotic	ribosomes	have	a	different	structure	from	that	of	eukaryotic	ribosomes,	and	thus	antibiotics	can	specifically	target	bacterial	infections	without	any	detriment	to	a	eukaryotic	host's	cells.

A	communist	state	is	a	state	where	the	means	of	production	are	collectively	owned	by	the	society.

<negative>
Technically,	"communist	state"	is	a	contradictio	in	terminis	as	a	communist	society	as	defined	by	both	Marxists	and	anarcho-communists	is	in	principle	stateless.

<negative>
From	this	perspective,	the	term	Marxist-Leninist	state	is	more	appropriate.

<negative>
Historically,	a	"communist	state"	referred	to	a	system	where	public	ownership	of	all	or	most	means	of	production	by	the	Communist	party	-run	state	is	deemed	necessary	to	further	the	interests	of	the	working	class	;	today,	a	communist	state	can	also,	for	instance,	refer	to	contemporary	China	and	Vietnam,	where	a	Communist	Party-run	state	exists	alongside	a	mixed	economy	.

According	to	Marxist–Leninists,	the	state	is	a	tool	in	the	hands	of	the	ruling	class	,	which	in	a	socialist	society	is	the	working	class,	so	a	socialist	state	is,	according	to	Leninists,	a	state	of	the	working	class	.
