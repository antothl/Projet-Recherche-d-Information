Chronic	kidney	disease	(CKD),	also	known	as	chronic	renal	disease,	is	a	progressive	loss	in	renal	function	over	a	period	of	months	or	years.

The	symptoms	of	worsening	kidney	function	are	non-specific,	and	might	include	feeling	generally	unwell	and	experiencing	a	reduced	appetite	.

Often,	chronic	kidney	disease	is	diagnosed	as	a	result	of	screening	of	people	known	to	be	at	risk	of	kidney	problems,	such	as	those	with	high	blood	pressure	or	diabetes	and	those	with	a	blood	relative	with	chronic	kidney	disease.

<negative>
Chronic	kidney	disease	is	identified	by	a	blood	test	for	creatinine	.

<negative>
Creatinine	levels	may	be	normal	in	the	early	stages	of	CKD,	and	the	condition	is	discovered	if	urinalysis	(testing	of	a	urine	sample)	shows	that	the	kidney	is	allowing	the	loss	of	protein	or	red	blood	cells	into	the	urine.
</negative>
<negative>
To	fully	investigate	the	underlying	cause	of	kidney	damage,	various	forms	of	medical	imaging	,	blood	tests	and	often	renal	biopsy	(removing	a	small	sample	of	kidney	tissue)	are	employed	to	find	out	if	there	is	a	reversible	cause	for	the	kidney	malfunction.

Recent	professional	guidelines	classify	the	severity	of	chronic	kidney	disease	in	five	stages,	with	stage	1	being	the	mildest	and	usually	causing	few	symptoms	and	stage	5	being	a	severe	illness	with	poor	life	expectancy	if	untreated.

<negative>
Stage	5	CKD	is	often	called	End	Stage	Renal	Disease	(ESRD)	and	is	synonymous	with	the	now	outdated	terms	chronic	kidney	failure	(CKF)	or	chronic	renal	failure	(CRF).

<negative>
LTE,	an	initialism	of	long-term	evolution,	marketed	as	4G	LTE,	is	a	standard	for	wireless	communication	of	high-speed	data	for	mobile	phones	and	data	terminals.
</negative>

It	is	based	on	the	GSM	/	EDGE	and	UMTS	/	HSPA	network	technologies,	increasing	the	capacity	and	speed	using	a	different	radio	interface	together	with	core	network	improvements.
</negative>
<negative>

<negative>
LTE	is,	therefore,	anticipated	to	become	the	first	truly	global	mobile	phone	standard,	although	the	use	of	different	frequency	bands	in	different	countries	will	mean	that	only	multi-band	phones	will	be	able	to	use	LTE	in	all	countries	where	it	is	supported.

Although	marketed	as	a	4G	wireless	service,	LTE	as	specified	in	the	3GPP	Release	8	and	9	document	series	does	not	satisfy	the	technical	requirements	the	3GPP	consortium	has	adopted	for	its	new	standard	generation,	and	which	were	originally	set	forth	by	the	ITU-R	organization	in	its	IMT-Advanced	specification.

<negative>
However,	due	to	marketing	pressures	and	the	significant	advancements	that	WIMAX	,	HSPA+	and	LTE	bring	to	the	original	3G	technologies,	ITU	later	decided	that	LTE	together	with	the	aforementioned	technologies	can	be	called	4G	technologies.

When	traversing	network	adapters,	switches,	routers	and	other	network	nodes	,	packets	are	buffered	and	queued,	resulting	in	variable	delay	and	throughput	depending	on	the	traffic	load	in	the	network.

Duomo	is	a	term	for	a	cathedral	church.
</negative>
<negative>
The	formal	word	for	a	church	that	is	currently	a	cathedral	is	cattedrale;	a	Duomo	may	be	either	a	present	or	a	former	cathedral	(the	latter	always	in	a	town	that	no	longer	has	a	bishop	nor	therefore	a	cathedral,	as	for	example	Trevi	).

Many	people	refer	to	particular	churches	simply	as	"Il	Duomo"	or	"The	Duomo",	without	regard	to	the	full	proper	name	of	the	church.
</negative>
<negative>
Similar	words	exist	in	other	languages:	Dom	(German),	Dóm	(Hungarian	&	Slovakian),	Dôme	(French),	Domkirke	(Danish),	Dómkirkja	(Icelandic),Domo	(Portuguese)	Domkyrka	(Swedish),	Domkirke	(Norwegian),	Doms	(Latvian),	Toomkirik	(Estonian),	Tum	(Polish),	and	Tuomiokirkko	(Finnish).
</negative>
<negative>
Also	in	these	languages	the	respective	terms	do	not	necessarily	refer	to	a	church	functioning	as	a	cathedral,	but	also	to	proto-cathedrals	or	simply	prominent	church	buildings,	which	have	never	been	a	cathedral	in	the	exact	sense	of	that	word.

<negative>
In	German	the	term	Dom	became	the	synecdoche	,	used	-	pars	pro	toto	-	for	most	existing	or	former	collegiate	churches	.
</negative>
<negative>
Therefore	the	uniform	translation	of	these	terms	into	English	as	cathedrals	may	not	always	be	appropriate	and	should	be	used	on	a	contextual	basis.
</negative>
<negative>
According	to	the	Oxford	English	Dictionary	,	and	to	Lo	Zingarelli	,	the	word	derives	from	the	Latin	word	"",	meaning	house,	as	a	cathedral	is	the	"house	of	God",	or	domus	Dei.
</negative>
<negative>
The	Garzanti	online	dictionary	also	gives	the	etymology	as	deriving	from	house,	but	house	of	the	bishop	("domu(m)	(episcopi);	'casa	(del	vescovo)')	instead	of	the	house	of	God.

Antibody	genes	also	re-organize	in	a	process	called	class	switching	that	changes	the	base	of	the	heavy	chain	to	another,	creating	a	different	isotype	of	the	antibody	that	retains	the	antigen	specific	variable	region.

Taste	is	the	sensation	produced	when	a	substance	in	the	mouth	reacts	chemically	with	receptors	of	taste	buds.
</negative>
<negative>
Taste,	along	with	smell	(	olfaction	)	and	trigeminal	nerve	stimulation	(which	also	handles	touch	for	texture,	also	pain,	and	temperature),	determines	flavors	,	the	sensory	impressions	of	food	or	other	substances.

how	thick	is	26	gauge	wire
</question>
<negative>
American	wire	gauge	(AWG),	also	known	as	the	Brown	&	Sharpe	wire	gauge,	is	a	standardized	wire	gauge	system	used	since	1857	predominantly	in	the	United	States	and	Canada	for	the	diameters	of	round,	solid,	nonferrous,	electrically	conducting	wire.
</negative>
<negative>
The	cross-sectional	area	of	each	gauge	is	an	important	factor	for	determining	its	current-carrying	capacity	.
</negative>
<negative>
The	steel	industry	does	not	use	AWG	and	prefers	a	number	of	other	wire	gauges.

These	include	Washburn	&	Moen	(or	W&M)	Wire	Gauge,	US	Steel	Wire	Gauge,	and	Music	Wire	Gauge	(see	Piano	wire	).

Increasing	gauge	numbers	give	decreasing	wire	diameters,	which	is	similar	to	many	other	non-	metric	gauging	systems.
</negative>
<negative>
This	gauge	system	originated	in	the	number	of	drawing	operations	used	to	produce	a	given	gauge	of	wire.
</negative>
<negative>
Very	fine	wire	(for	example,	30	gauge)	required	more	passes	through	the	drawing	dies	than	did	0	gauge	wire.
</negative>
<negative>
Manufacturers	of	wire	formerly	had	proprietary	wire	gauge	systems;	the	development	of	standardized	wire	gauges	rationalized	selection	of	wire	for	a	particular	purpose.
</negative>
<negative>
The	AWG	tables	are	for	a	single,	solid,	round	conductor.
</negative>
<negative>
The	AWG	of	a	stranded	wire	is	determined	by	the	total	cross-sectional	area	of	the	conductor,	which	determines	its	current-carrying	capacity	and	electrical	resistance	.
</negative>
<negative>
Because	there	are	also	small	gaps	between	the	strands,	a	stranded	wire	will	always	have	a	slightly	larger	overall	diameter	than	a	solid	wire	with	the	same	AWG.

what	are	points	on	a	mortgage
</question>

Points,	sometimes	also	called	a	"discount	point",	are	a	form	of	pre-paid	interest	.
</positive>
<negative>
One	point	equals	one	percent	of	the	loan	amount.
</negative>
<negative>
By	charging	a	borrower	points,	a	lender	effectively	increases	the	yield	on	the	loan	above	the	amount	of	the	stated	interest	rate	.
</negative>
<negative>
Borrowers	can	offer	to	pay	a	lender	points	as	a	method	to	reduce	the	interest	rate	on	the	loan,	thus	obtaining	a	lower	monthly	payment	in	exchange	for	this	up-front	payment.
</negative>
<negative>
For	each	point	purchased,	the	loan	rate	is	typically	reduced	by	1/8%	(0.125%).

There	will	be	a	specific	point	in	the	timeline	of	the	loan	where	the	money	spent	to	buy	down	the	interest	rate	will	be	equal	to	the	money	saved	by	making	reduced	loan	payments	resulting	from	the	lower	interest	rate	on	the	loan.
</negative>
<negative>
Selling	the	property	or	refinancing	prior	to	this	break-even	point	will	result	in	a	net	financial	loss	for	the	buyer	while	keeping	the	loan	for	longer	than	this	break-even	point	will	result	in	a	net	financial	savings	for	the	buyer.
</negative>
<negative>
The	longer	you	keep	the	property	financed	under	the	loan	with	purchased	points,	the	more	the	money	spent	on	the	points	will	pay	off.
</negative>
<negative>
Accordingly,	if	the	intention	is	to	buy	and	sell	the	property	or	refinance	in	a	rapid	fashion,	buying	points	is	actually	going	to	end	up	costing	more	than	just	paying	the	loan	at	the	higher	interest	rate.
</negative>
<negative>
Points	may	also	be	purchased	to	reduce	the	monthly	payment	for	the	purpose	of	qualifying	for	a	loan.
</negative>
<negative>
Loan	qualification	based	on	monthly	income	versus	the	monthly	loan	payment	may	sometimes	only	be	achievable	by	reducing	the	monthly	payment	through	the	purchasing	of	points	to	buy	down	the	interest	rate,	thereby	reducing	the	monthly	loan	payment.
</negative>
<negative>
Discount	points	may	be	different	from	origination	fee	or	broker	fee	.
</negative>
<negative>
Discount	points	are	always	used	to	buy	down	the	interest	rates,	while	origination	fees	sometimes	are	fees	the	lender	charges	for	the	loan	or	sometimes	just	another	name	for	buying	down	the	interest	rate.

Origination	fee	and	discount	points	are	both	items	listed	under	lender-charges	on	the	HUD-1	Settlement	Statement	.
</negative>
<negative>
The	difference	in	savings	over	the	life	of	the	loan	can	make	paying	points	a	benefit	to	the	borrower.
</negative>
<negative>
If	you	intend	to	stay	in	your	home	for	an	extended	period	of	time,	it	may	be	worthwhile	to	pay	additional	points	in	order	to	obtain	a	lower	interest	rate.

Any	significant	changes	in	fees	should	be	re-disclosed	in	the	final	good	faith	estimate	(GFE).

Also	directly	related	to	points	is	the	concept	of	the	'	no	closing	cost	loan	'.

Sam	and	colleague	Martin	Kamen	,	a	University	of	Chicago	Ph.D.	and	researcher	in	chemistry	and	nuclear	physics	working	under	Ernest	O.	Lawrence	at	the	Berkeley	Radiation	Laboratory	,	set	out	to	elucidate	the	path	of	carbon	in	photosynthesis	by	incorporating	the	short-lived	radioactive	isotope	Carbon-11	(11CO2)	in	their	many	experiments	between	1938	and	1942.
</negative>
<negative>
Aided	by	the	concepts	and	collaboration	of	C.	B.	van	Niel	,	at	Stanford	University	’s	Hopkins	Marine	Station	,	it	became	clear	to	them	that	reduction	of	CO2	can	occur	in	the	dark	and	may	involve	processes	similar	to	bacterial	systems.

Atherosclerosis	(also	known	as	arteriosclerotic	vascular	disease	or	ASVD)	is	a	condition	in	which	an	artery	wall	thickens	as	a	result	of	the	accumulation	of	fatty	materials	such	as	cholesterol	and	triglyceride	.
</positive>
<positive>
It	is	a	syndrome	affecting	arterial	blood	vessels	,	a	chronic	inflammatory	response	in	the	walls	of	arteries,	caused	largely	by	the	accumulation	of	macrophage	white	blood	cells	and	promoted	by	low-density	lipoproteins	(LDL,	plasma	proteins	that	carry	cholesterol	and	triglycerides	)	without	adequate	removal	of	fats	and	cholesterol	from	the	macrophages	by	functional	high-density	lipoproteins	(HDL)	(see	apoA-1	Milano	).

<negative>
Atherosclerotic	lesions,	or	atherosclerotic	plaques	are	separated	into	two	broad	categories:	Stable	and	unstable	(also	called	vulnerable).
</negative>
<negative>
The	pathobiology	of	atherosclerotic	lesions	is	very	complicated	but	generally,	stable	atherosclerotic	plaques,	which	tend	to	be	asymptomatic,	are	rich	in	extracellular	matrix	and	smooth	muscle	cells	,	while,	unstable	plaques	are	rich	in	macrophages	and	foam	cells	and	the	extracellular	matrix	separating	the	lesion	from	the	arterial	lumen	(also	known	as	the	fibrous	cap	)	is	usually	weak	and	prone	to	rupture.
</negative>
<negative>
Ruptures	of	the	fibrous	cap	expose	thrombogenic	material,	such	as	collagen	to	the	circulation	and	eventually	induce	thrombus	formation	in	the	lumen.
</negative>
<negative>
Upon	formation,	intraluminal	thrombi	can	occlude	arteries	outright	(i.e.	coronary	occlusion),	but	more	often	they	detach,	move	into	the	circulation	and	eventually	occlude	smaller	downstream	branches	causing	thromboembolism	(i.e.	Stroke	is	often	caused	by	thrombus	formation	in	the	carotid	arteries).
</negative>
<negative>
Apart	from	thromboembolism	,	chronically	expanding	atherosclerotic	lesions	can	cause	complete	closure	of	the	lumen.
</negative>
<negative>
Interestingly,	chronically	expanding	lesions	are	often	asymptomatic	until	lumen	stenosis	is	so	severe	that	blood	supply	to	downstream	tissue(s)	is	insufficient	resulting	in	ischemia	.
</negative>
<negative>
These	complications	of	advanced	atherosclerosis	are	chronic,	slowly	progressive	and	cumulative.
</negative>
<negative>
Most	commonly,	soft	plaque	suddenly	ruptures	(see	vulnerable	plaque	),	causing	the	formation	of	a	thrombus	that	will	rapidly	slow	or	stop	blood	flow,	leading	to	death	of	the	tissues	fed	by	the	artery	in	approximately	5	minutes.
</negative>

<positive>
In	family	law	and	public	policy,	child	support	(or	child	maintenance)	is	an	ongoing,	periodic	payment	made	by	a	parent	for	the	financial	benefit	of	a	child	following	the	end	of	a	marriage	or	other	relationship.
</positive>

There	are,	however,	many	exceptions	to	these	rules:	neurons	that	lack	dendrites,	neurons	that	have	no	axon,	synapses	that	connect	an	axon	to	another	axon	or	a	dendrite	to	another	dendrite,	etc.
</negative>
<negative>
All	neurons	are	electrically	excitable,	maintaining	voltage	gradients	across	their	membranes	by	means	of	metabolically	driven	ion	pumps	,	which	combine	with	ion	channels	embedded	in	the	membrane	to	generate	intracellular-versus-extracellular	concentration	differences	of	ions	such	as	sodium	,	potassium	,	chloride	,	and	calcium	.

Bowers	v.	Hardwick,	,	is	a	United	States	Supreme	Court	decision,	overturned	in	2003,	that	upheld,	in	a	5-4	ruling,	the	constitutionality	of	a	Georgia	sodomy	law	criminalizing	oral	and	anal	sex	in	private	between	consenting	adults	when	applied	to	homosexuals.

The	majority	opinion,	written	by	Justice	Byron	White	,	argued	that	the	Constitution	did	not	confer	"a	fundamental	right	to	engage	in	homosexual	sodomy."

A	concurring	opinion	by	Chief	Justice	Warren	E.	Burger	cited	the	"ancient	roots"	of	prohibitions	against	homosexual	sex,	quoting	William	Blackstone	's	description	of	homosexual	sex	as	an	"infamous	crime	against	nature",	worse	than	rape,	and	"a	crime	not	fit	to	be	named."

In	response	to	invocations	of	religious	taboos	against	homosexuality,	Blackmun	wrote:	"That	certain,	but	by	no	means	all,	religious	groups	condemn	the	behavior	at	issue	gives	the	State	no	license	to	impose	their	judgments	on	the	entire	citizenry.

Due	to	their	large	size	and	the	fact	that	they	contain	meat	from	two	of	the	most	prized	cuts	of	beef	(the	short	loin	and	the	tenderloin	),	T-bone	steaks	are	generally	considered	one	of	the	highest	quality	steaks,	and	prices	at	steakhouses	are	accordingly	high.

<negative>
Porterhouse	steaks	are	even	more	highly	valued	due	to	their	larger	tenderloin.

who	wrote	a	rose	is	a	rose	is	a	rose
</question>
<positive>
The	sentence	"Rose	is	a	rose	is	a	rose	is	a	rose."	was	written	by	Gertrude	Stein	as	part	of	the	1913	poem	Sacred	Emily,	which	appeared	in	the	1922	book	Geography	and	Plays.

<negative>
In	that	poem,	the	first	"Rose"	is	the	name	of	a	person.
</negative>
<negative>
Stein	later	used	variations	on	the	sentence	in	other	writings,	and	"A	rose	is	a	rose	is	a	rose"	is	probably	her	most	famous	quotation,	often	interpreted	as	meaning	"things	are	what	they	are,"	a	statement	of	the	law	of	identity	,	"A	is	A".
</negative>
<negative>
In	Stein's	view,	the	sentence	expresses	the	fact	that	simply	using	the	name	of	a	thing	already	invokes	the	imagery	and	emotions	associated	with	it,	an	idea	also	intensively	discussed	in	the	problem	of	universals	debate	where	Peter	Abelard	and	others	used	the	rose	as	an	example	concept.

who	wrote	the	song	for	star	wars

The	music	of	Star	Wars	consists	of	the	scores	written	for	all	six	Star	Wars	films	by	composer	John	Williams	from	1977	to	1983	for	the	Original	Trilogy	,	and	1999	to	2005	for	the	Prequel	Trilogy	.

<negative>
Williams'	scores	for	the	double	trilogy	count	among	the	most	widely	known	and	popular	contributions	to	modern	film	music	.
</negative>
<negative>
Additionally,	music	for	Star	Wars:	The	Clone	Wars	was	written	by	Kevin	Kiner,	and	further	music	has	been	composed	for	Star	Wars	video	games	and	works	in	other	media.
</negative>
<negative>
The	scores	utilize	an	eclectic	variety	of	musical	styles,	many	culled	from	the	Late	Romantic	idiom	of	Richard	Strauss	and	his	contemporaries	that	itself	was	incorporated	into	the	Golden	Age	Hollywood	scores	of	Erich	Korngold	and	Max	Steiner	.
</negative>
<negative>
While	several	obvious	nods	to	Gustav	Holst	,	William	Walton	and	Igor	Stravinsky	exist	in	the	score	to	Episode	IV	,	Williams	relied	less	and	less	on	classical	references	in	the	latter	five	scores,	incorporating	more	strains	of	modernist	orchestral	writing	with	each	progressive	score.
</negative>
<negative>
The	reasons	for	Williams'	tapping	of	a	familiar	Romantic	idiom	are	known	to	involve	Lucas'	desire	to	ground	the	otherwise	strange	and	fantastic	setting	in	well-known,	audience-accessible	music.
</negative>
<negative>
Indeed,	Lucas	maintains	much	of	the	trilogy's	success	relies	not	on	advanced	visual	effects,	but	on	the	simple,	direct	emotional	appeal	of	its	plot,	characters	and,	importantly,	music.

Star	Wars	often	is	credited	as	heralding	the	beginning	of	a	revival	of	grand	symphonic	scores	in	the	late	1970s.

One	technique	in	particular	is	an	influence:	Williams's	revival	of	a	technique	called	leitmotif	,	which	is	most	famously	associated	with	the	operas	of	Richard	Wagner	and,	in	film	scores,	with	Steiner.

<negative>
A	leitmotif	is	a	phrase	or	melodic	cell	that	signifies	a	character,	place,	plot	element,	mood,	idea,	relationship	or	other	specific	part	of	the	film.
